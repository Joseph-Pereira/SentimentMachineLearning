280809,B0017I1QAW,A1RT5A6U67HGYA,bipolypesca,6.0,6.0,5.0,1311724800.0,Perfect.,"Boy, does it make me sad to see so many people leaving comments about shipping problems as ""reviews,"" rating the product down because of the service received.  This salsa has only a 4 star average rating, strictly because of people who don't understand what a product review is, and it's unfair both to the manufacturer of the product (in this case a relatively small, family-owned operation in Texas called Riba Foods), nor shoppers who are trying to find a good product based on this review system.  How I wish Amazon would offer a ""this is not a review"" button as opposed to just ""helpful,"" ""not helpful,"" and ""abuse.""  (We can all click ""not helpful,"" but that doesn't counter the inaccurate product rating; and it's not ""abuse,"" just ignorance.)<br /><br />Here--before I get rightfully accused of hypocrisy--is my REVIEW of this SALSA: It's fantastic.  There are very, very few salsas sold in run-of-the-mill grocery stores marketed as ""hot"" that are actually HOT.  I have had ""hot"" salsas that list no type of hot chilies in the ingredients, and show it.  I have had ""hot"" salsas that were as tepid as canned tomatoes.  I have had ""hot"" salsas that, while tasty, just barely break the medium barrier.  This is not one of those.  It is actually spicy, how-about-some-milk, oh-dear-is-that-stomach-acid-in-my-throat-lining, this-can't-be-good-for-my-ulcer HOT!  I love it!<br /><br />An aside: The only other relatively widely available hot salsa that I can think of is Mrs. Renfro's Mango Habanero.  I love that one, too, but it suffers from the unfortunate problem of being too thin.  Watery thin.  With very few chunks.  The taste is fantastic, but the texture is monumentally disappointing.<br /><br />Well, not so with this one: The texture is perfect--it's thick and it clings to the chip.  You can see all the little flecks of roasted chili skin in there, and all the seeds, too.<br /><br />The one thing that threw me about this salsa--and made me bypass it several times before finally trying it--is that the ingredients list contains carrots.  ...CARROTS?  That's just weird.<br /><br />What's even weirder is that there is no hint of them in the salsa.  No carrot flavour, no carrot texture, and I can't find a chunk of carrot in that jar to save my life.  I suspect they might be pureed for thickening--maybe that's what makes the salsa thicker and more clingy than you usually get with a traditional Mexican roasted salsa like this one.<br /><br />You can taste the roasted pepper flavour, you can really feel the heat, the tomatoes are stellar, and it's not too salty (the tortilla chip provides enough of that!).  The burn lasts, too.  I find myself sucking air over my tongue for several minutes after I've stopped indulging.<br /><br />If you like truly spicy salsa without having to track down a specialty chilihead shoppe, and you know the deliciousness of roasted peppers (heck, roasted anything!), then give it a try.  I can't imagine you would regret it.<br /><br />Oh, and when you do try it and find you love it: Do everyone a favour and leave a review on the product about the PRODUCT.  If you think it's a five star salsa with 2 star shipping... the proper rating is FIVE STARS.  Not four, not three, but five.  Save your shipping complaints for the SHIPPER.  It's only fair.",positive,1,556

330358,B005ATVY88,AC5UIM0EA1BNZ,PalFam,4.0,4.0,4.0,1322611200.0,Good results but contains soy,"I received Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food to try as a BzzAgent.  I'm feeding this to my terrier as he tends to show the results to changes in his diet quicker than my Corgi or Belgian Sheepdog.  I've been a dog mom for more than 20 years, including participating in dog sports such as sled dog running, agility and dog shows.  Proper nutrition is vital to dogs' health and ability to participate in things they love to do.  While I currently don't do these activities with my dogs, I still am very picky about what they eat.<br /><br />When I received my BzzKit, a 4lb bag of Hill's Science Diet, Ideal Balance Dog Food, I checked the ingredients.  The first listed is chicken (good!) followed by brown rice and whole grain wheat (not as good as a meat ingredient, but better than it being corn).  Next is cracked pearl barley, soybean meal and chicken meal.  I have to admit I paused at the soybean meal.  In my experience, soy has not been a positive addition to dog food.  I find that foods that contain it result in looser stools of greater volume, and the dog's overall condition is not as high as one fed a food without soy.  It's an inexpensive ingredient that is associated with ""filler"" in the dog community.  I was curious to see how my terrier would handle and fare on this food. 3 stars for only one meat ingredient in the first 5 ingredients, and for the inclusion of soy.<br /><br />Rex, my terrier, became immediately interested when I opened the bag.  He was VERY anxious to see what was in there, so the smell must have been very enticing.  He's not a picky eater, so I anticipated he'd like the Ideal Balance, but didn't anticipate how eager he was to get it!  I slowly, over the course of days, switched him to Ideal Balance from his previous food (to reduce stomach upset from a diet change), and found he ate the Ideal Balance nuggets first before cleaning his bowl.  It may be because it was new and novel, but it may have been because he liked it better.  He's a dog...he couldn't tell me.  He seems to like it so much that I can even use Ideal Balance as a training treat.  5 Stars for taste.<br /><br />Rex has been eating Ideal Balance for a couple of weeks now.  It's not long enough for a complete picture of its impact on his condition, but long enough to get an idea of how it's going for him.<br /><br />His coat is very nice.  It was nice before, and I haven't seen any change in the coat condition.  The Ideal Balance diet is at least maintaining his coat in good condition.  We need more time to see the food's long term impact in Rex's coat.  4 stars for coat maintenance.<br /><br />Rex has a tendency to gain weight.  We really have to watch how much he eats.  And Ideal Balance helps him pack it on!  This means I can feed him less, which means I'm buying less food in the long run.  But I really have to watch his weight.  And it means that he is getting a lot out of the food.  The crude protein is 21.5% and crude fat is 12.5%.  The protein is not high, but the fat content is maybe a little higher than I'd seek for him.  I might choose a weight control version of Ideal Balance if this becomes his regular diet (and if one exists).  5 stars for body weight maintenance.<br /><br />Now the down and dirty part of the review...stools.  A dog's stool can tell you a lot about how he is tolerating his diet.  Rex's stools on Ideal Balance are firm, maybe a little larger than they were on his previous food, and do not smell any more objectionable than normal.  This tells me he is digesting the food normally, as well as close to optimally.  They could be a little smaller, but not so much that if I wasn't looking for a change that I'd have necessarily noticed it.  5 stars for stool quality.<br /><br />Overall, I give Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food 4 stars.  If there were a 2nd meat source and/or soy wasn't present, I could in good faith give it 5 stars, based on Rex's condition on the diet.  If you do try it, be sure to monitor your dog's weight, and adjust how much you feed accordingly.",positive,1,758

This Fog Lifter brand does not.  The flavor is perfect, no bitterness and the strength is even good at the highest setting on my Keurig (travel mug size).  I only add a little heavy whipping cream to my coffee and it is the best (if you have never tried ""heavy whipping cream"", give it a shot), you don't know what your are missing, yes, it has fat, but no carbs, no sugars.<br /><br />Anyway I knew these were not traditional K-Cup, but who cares, in fact, I think this design is far superior.  The filter material is a bit thicker than the normal K-Cup paper filter, so the fact that the coffee does not drip through a single hole, does not matter, the flavor is still great.  The only thing that would make these better would be if they came in resealable bags, but then the price would go up.  I either just cut the corner off of the bag, then seal it with a plastic chip clip, or lately I have been buying Davidsons Tea.  The tea comes in a large foil-paper resealable bag. When my tea ran out, I started dropping my Fog Lifter cups in these bags, works great.

I enjoy Rooibos on occasion and use it for chai when serving to people who are sensative to caffine.<br /><br />One important point about Rooibos is that it isn't technically tea it doesn't come from the Camellia Sinensis fmaily and therefore is considered an herbal.  It's a common mistake to label things which aren't true tea as teas, but a bigger mistake would be to label this ""espresso"".<br /><br />The only thing Red Espresso has in common with Espresso (aside from how you may chose to prepare it) is how it is ground.  When dealing with herbals and teas the more surface area that the water has contact with when you brew it, the more bitter the resulting beverage. With Red Espresso, rather than getting a sweet and clean tasting beverage, that you'd get from traditionally prepared rooibos, you get one which is much more bitter and sharp.<br /><br />I tried preparing this tea a number of different ways and found it took a lot to get the water to grounds ratio right. With only one exception I was never quite pleased with the resulting beverage.  The best luck I had with Red Espresso was to put it on the stovetop in water and then add chai spices to the mix, drain through a strainer and then adding milk and sweetner.<br /><br />I recognize people will turn to products like this for the health benefits, but I think they'll be disappointed with the experience of drinking this like coffee. For a much better coffee substitute I recommend Choffy which approximates the taste of coffee much closer.<br /><br />But if you're looking to give up your regular cup-o-joe for tea, this isn't the way to go. You'd be much better served picking up some Yunnan Gold or an Assam black tea, brewing it strong and adding milk and sweetener (if desired). If you're set on rooibos then look for the full unground needles to use to brew a much more pleasant cup.",negative,-1,350

Baby formula does not pour well and can get caught in the tinest of wrinkle and then come rushing out when it makes it way past. It's very light and fluffy so spills go everywhere. The single serve sticks are also larger, longer in length and can take up space in your diaper bag, you can't fold them up it's just awkward all around, especially to pour them in the car or at the mall, etc. Not to mention EXPENSIVE. Really EXPENSIVE, 8 packs for $12-$16. Meaning 8 bottles for that, when a whole formula case is $25. MAKE YOUR OWN SINGLE SERVE SOLUTIONS! I really can't express to you how awful the packaging is on these, they spill every single time, I'm no butterfingers so I know it's not me. The tear wrong, the formula comes gushing out after you try to coax it down when it gets stuck no matter how hard you try to flatten it out before you open. All in all, this is a great idea in theory, it just fails in design.<br /><br />Here are two cheaper and more efficient solutions:<br /><br /> Most moms have and use either the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RFCXIK"">Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser Combo Pack, Colors Vary</a> or a variant of it ( hear its not as good as this one and I believe it). We got a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006BAJIG"">Philips AVENT Formula BPA-Free Dispenser/Snack Cup</a>and I think it's excellent quality and wonderful, the dividers do not ""leak"" into each other at all since it's one piece mold, and you can just take it out if you want to use for snacks, it's a must have. That said, its so big in my diaper bag. I like to have as much room in my bag as I can, and every inch counts.<br /><br />So I got These plastic bags make it possible. Plus if I have sports powdered mixes, etc I can use these as well for myself.  Why not make your own single serve pouches? I looked into a few kinds and these <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EDINH8"">500 Poly Bag Clear Zipper Shipping Bags 3"" X 4""</a> were the best economically, (bags for cost) I can pack 3 or 4 bottles worth in the same space that a pack of altoids would take up, less actually. About 2 or 3 on top of each other is the thickness of my iphone 4. I can fit about 8 bags inside the avent formula dispenser. This is way better than the size more conventional formula dispensers hold. The best way to pour it into your cup or baby bottle ( from experience ) is to pinch it at the ziplock seam, open it so that the left corner is touching the right corner, and pour it out. Never spill a drop, no mess all over the place, love it.<br /><br />That said I would NEVER Give up the avent formula dispenser, I actually bought another because I love using them at home. I sit these out on the counter and I don't have to clutter up the kitchen, plus when a baby sitter comes over I just tell her pour one compartment into the bottle and shake. I also fill up bottles of water and have them waiting at the ready so I practically have to  nothing to make a bottle when I am tired or relying on others. These are a must have. If you don't want to fuss with the baggies, I would say this is the best compact formula dispenser for your money and on the market, hands down it sweeps the competition. Don't buy the cheaper ones, their dividers SUCK and the lid is iffy. This is the one that works best. Also, the best way to pout it out and get it all out quick and fast is to line up the hole with the bottle and SHAKE SIDE TO SIDE Rapidly. Back and forth, left to right, three or four times and it's all out! Don't worry, you wont spill and the formula wont get mixed up in the compartments.<br /><br />These options are the best value for your money. You have a new baby, you have PLENTY of other things to spend your money on, the list never ends babies suck you dry, so don't waste the money on these if you don't have to.

When you read the label, you see a lot of nutrition and few calories for just 2 tablespoons. But much of what wheat germ has is not on the label. For instance, it promotes gentle regularity and is an excellent source of chromium, selenium, and other trace minerals. It is also a balanced package of protein, carbohydrates and fat, without saturated fat. It promotes heart health and provides an energetic feeling. Mixed with vitamin C, some people use it as a very effective antihistamine without side effects.<br /><br />Since 1982, I have incorporated ""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" into my daily diet. The easiest ways to achieve this are as follows:<br /><br />1] Adding to cold cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, soups, homemade bread, puddings, macaroni and cheese, applesauce and literally anything you want that has sufficient moisture.<br /><br />2] Substituting wheat germ for bread crumbs in meatloaf, veal/ chicken cutlets, or any fried batter.<br /><br />Kretschmer's Wheat Germ comes toasted in a vacuum-sealed bottle which makes it a very stable and fresh product. It even has an expiration date printed across the top of the bottle in plain sight. Raw wheat germ from the health food store tastes awful, turns rancid sometimes before you buy it, and is usually poorly packaged.<br /><br />This ""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" gets a 5 for nutrition, ease of use, packaging, and value which makes Kretschmer's Wheat Germ hard to beat. Oh, I forget to mention --IT TASTES GOOD TOO!<br /><br />DOWNSIDE: This 12 ounce package costs only $1.00 less than the 20-ounce package and should be passed by when the 20-ounce size is available.

Some are clearly NOT good for you, some are, and some are just OK. You aren't going to be on a 3-hour sugar buzz, but neither are you really doing yourself that huge of a favor. Perhaps you are one of those who thought Raisin Bran was good for you... until you found out it has more sugar than Fruit Loops!<br /><br />Enter Quaker Oatmeal Squares, in this case infused with ""a hint"" of cinnamon. My first two thoughts are 1) must be good for you if it's from Quaker Oats! and 2) mmm... cinnamon!<br /><br />Bottom line: IF you sweeten it a bit, this cereal is good and crunchy at first. It does NOT have an overwhelming cinnamon flavor, and in some ways is a bit bland. But the flavor is acceptable. The crunch will wear off quickly, though, if you let it soak for more than a couple of minutes.<br /><br />The pitch is that ""each square has cinnamon baked into it"". Well, honestly, does it matter if it's baked in or sprinkled on? I think it could use a bit more flavor, but that's mostly just my opinion. Others may find it just right. The cereal consists of 46 grams of whole grains per serving, so that part is good. If you are going to consume cereal, you should consume those made with whole grains. It also packs a decent amount of soluble fiber (5g) and protein (6g - high for a dry cereal). There are 210 calories in a 1 cup serving of Quaker Oatmeal Squares Cereal (Cinnamon). The caloric breakdown is: 10% fat, 79% carbs, 11% protein. The cereal has 9g of sugar per serving.<br /><br />So if you're a cereal eater and looking for something healthier than Cap'n Crunch, this is probably a ""better"" selection. That said, I caution anyone against starting their day with a ton of carbohydrates, especially those derived from sugary sources. And as with anything, be aware of what a ""serving"" is and practice moderation. If not measured out, many folks would potentially consume 2-3 servings (in this case cups) in a single bowl, which would equate to a quick 400-600 calories just for breakfast!",neutral,0,378

I usually break each one into 3 pieces (2 leaves each) and it's a good size for my 20lb pup.  After reading the ingredients, I was under the impression that they'd be kinda chewy but they're baked and hard/crunchy.  The pup takes about 8-10 seconds to finish each 2 leaf piece which is sometimes a little long when trying to train commands and etc but I just break the treats down even more if I need her to eat faster.  The flavor I bought, Pumpkin and Apple, smells great and they don't leave crumbles in my pocket when we're on the go.<br />One thing I should add though is that if you break the fruitables treats into pieces, you'll notice that they're pretty fibrous.

There is plenty of technical information about what to feed your dog and, nearly overwhelmed, we entered the pet food market with an idea of feeding a quality kibble, but chose to avoid high-end designer food, high protein (>26%), bi-products, wheat, soy, and corn. We decided that whole grains, fruits, and vegitables would be an acceptable source of carbohydrates but wanted the ratio to be 40% or less (hard to do when you avoid high protien foods). We also believe chicken is the easiest protein source for our dog to digest. Lastly, we wanted to be near 24% Protien and 14% Fat. Keep in mind that our review below is based on our pet, and every pet will react to food differently.<br /><br />We fed Precise, which was only a great puppy food. We fed Canadae, which resulted in loose stool, gas and a pretty lethargic pet. We did some more research and decided to try Nature's Variety, the result was shocking!

Her ideal weight is approximately 6-7lbs, however she currently weighs approximately 9lbs (this is my fault, I overdid it on the treats). She loved her Wellness brand super5mix adult formula for small breeds kibble, but I recently noticed the small breeds weight reduction version being sold at PetSupermarket, and decided to switch her over.<br /><br />I was worried she would not like it, as I had once unsuccessfully tried to switch her over to the other Wellness Super5Mix weight control kibble (purple bag, normal sized kibble). Surprisingly she took to the taste of the Wellness Small Breed Weight Control kibble almost immediately. I didn't even need to ween her off of the Wellness original kibble, just gave her the weight control formula and she liked it, no problems with her digestion. The color of the kibble is slightly less brown than the original adult formula, but she did not seem to notice a difference at all. She likes the small size of the kibble, and recently I have noticed that she has lost about 4 ounces... not much but it is a start. Hopefully with exercise and some restraint by me, she will be within her normal weight range, but I am happy I made the switch and will continue to purchase this brand.<br />TIP: My dog is a picky eater, so I sometimes mix a bit of water into the food which causes the food to give off an aroma, which draws her to it. It also makes it easier for her to eat because it softens the kibble. It's also good because it keeps her hydrated... Just an FYI.",positive,1,277

I heard about Xylitol from a naturopathic student, that basically, the bad bacteria in your mouth feed on Xylitol but they can't digest it, and the good bacteria can eat it, so they proliferate. I thought I had tried other Xylitol gums in the past and didn't like them, but I decided to give this another chance because I want a gum to chew after meals that is actually good for my teeth. I was pleasantly surprised at the Spry gum! It has a great flavor (which goes away pretty soon after chewing, but it's a nice shot of good taste), but the best part is that the gum itself has a great texture to it and continues to be fun to chew for as long as you want. It doesn't even turn hard after drinking water like most gums do. I am a medical student so I did a search of the research literature and the claims of Xylitol are more than proven. However, all of the literature and research studies explain that you need 4-12 g of Xylitol a day (no need to get more than 15), but the average piece of gum has .75-1 g, so you'll need to chew at least 4-5 pieces a day to get the dental benefits (chewing it only sporadically, i.e. once a day, did NOT show any dental benefits).

My kids had been dying to try this stuff ever since they had come across it on J-Box, the popular Japanese import webshop. Ramune is incredibly popular in it's native Japan, and now it looks like the fun is beginning to spread here in the States.<br /><br />To open a bottle of Ramune, you have to remove the top, pop out this little plastic plunger from it's casing, and then use the plunger to pop out a marble that seals the neck of the bottle. The neck of the bottle has two indentions that will hold the marble when you tip the bottle back to drink from it, keeping the neck of the bottle clear. Hold the bottle the wrong way, and the marble will clog things up. You can avoid carbonated overflow when opening by pressing gently on the plunger until it depresses the marble; knock it down with force and you're sure to get a fountain of spray.<br /><br />The original flavor reviewed here tastes a lot like Sprite, but Ramune also comes in several other flavors. It uses high fructose corn syrup and/or cane sugar as a sweetener (It lists both on the label, which usually means that it uses whatever is cheapest on the world market at the time of bottling. Listing both also means that they don't have to change their labeling every time they change sweetener.)<br /><br />This is a way fun product that kids (and most adults) will have a blast with. It's a smaller portion (8 ounces) than what we're used to here in the US, but that actually works out for us as we're trying to limit the amount of soda that our kids consume. Ramune works great as an occasional soda treat and the fun factor alone keeps us coming back for more.<br /><br />Ramune six-packs are easy to find at just about any Asian market at around $7 or $8. If you have to order online, try some of the various Asian food sites out there as the price here is just too high to justify unless you have absolutely no other option.<br /><br />Also, for the safety conscious, I can attest that these drinks are very safe. We've never had a problem with the marble, and I can't find any reports on the internet that would indicate any safety concerns with this drink. It's not a choking hazard, in other words. Ramune means 'carbonated' in Japanese, and I can highly recommend this wonderful and very different drink.",positive,1,437

When you read the label, you see a lot of nutrition and few calories for just 2 tablespoons. But much of what wheat germ has is not on the label. For instance, it promotes gentle regularity and is an excellent source of chromium, selenium, and other trace minerals. It is also a balanced package of protein, carbohydrates and fat, without saturated fat. It promotes heart health and provides an energetic feeling. Mixed with vitamin C, some people use it as a very effective antihistamine without side effects.<br /><br />Since 1982, I have incorporated ""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" into my daily diet. The easiest ways to achieve this are as follows:<br /><br />1] Adding to cold cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, soups, homemade bread, puddings, macaroni and cheese, applesauce and literally anything you want that has sufficient moisture.<br /><br />2] Substituting wheat germ for bread crumbs in meatloaf, veal/ chicken cutlets, or any fried batter.<br /><br />Kretschmer's Wheat Germ comes toasted in a vacuum-sealed bottle which makes it a very stable and fresh product. It even has an expiration date printed across the top of the bottle in plain sight. Raw wheat germ from the health food store tastes awful, turns rancid sometimes before you buy it, and is usually poorly packaged.<br /><br />This ""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" gets a 5 for nutrition, ease of use, packaging, and value which makes Kretschmer's Wheat Germ hard to beat. Oh, I forget to mention --IT TASTES GOOD TOO!<br /><br />DOWNSIDE: This 12 ounce package costs only $1.00 less than the 20-ounce package and should be passed by when the 20-ounce size is available.

I like the fact that this product wheat free, soy free, corn free, gluten free peanut free and to top everything off it's certified kosher. In my opinion the ginger snapz tasted good ... very 'snappy' - for lack of a better word. When you are allergic to the things I am allergic to you read the labels/ingredients of foods/snacks and you notice that pretty much everything contains SOMETHING that you are allergic to. So I am grateful for this product being made. I've read several reviews and I've noticed that most of the people who gave the ginger snapz a low rating kept saying they had a sandy taste. FYI: Look at the ingredients, it contains rice flour. Rice flour has a sandy/grainy type of feeling when eaten/felt. With that being said, I let my mom and my brother taste the ginger snapz. (Both of them aren't allergic to anything whatsoever). They said that it tasted good but it left a grainy/sandy after taste in their mouths. Once again, this product does contain rice flour. With that being said, remember people - this product has no wheat, soy, corn, or peanuts. I give credit where credit is due, they stripped some of the most common ingredients that people are allergic to and still ended up with an excellent tasting snack. 4 out of 5 because after I ate about 6 snapz and got over the actual feeling of me actually eating something that I wasn't allergic to *smiles* ..

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea.

The first 4 ingredients are all meats- human-grade at that! Besides having less ""filler"", Canidae uses no corn products, which is good for dogs with allergies (corn is a common allergen in dogs). Some may balk at the price, but you are going to use less food per day then with the junk brands due to the high quality of indredients in this stuff. Besides, Canidae is considerably cheaper then most of the other top-shelf brands like Eagle Pack or Flint River. I'm just happy to be able to feed my dog a ""super-premium"" grade food knowing how much healthier this is for him, for just a few bucks more per bag then a mid-grade food like Iams or Pro Plan.

When I got it, I opted to have two servings at once, since I'm what you might call a tall drink of water (or lemon lotus drink, as the case may be), and after making the drink and seeing how easily it dissolved , I resisted my urge to pinch my nose and down it in one.<br /><br />It tasted GOOD!

They are about twice as expensive as the milk-bones at Amazon, FWIW, but that is consistent with many organic foods.<br /><br />I have tested my dog a few times to see which she prefers, making her sit and putting one of each on the floor. The first time, she went straight for the Newman's. The next several times, she went straight for the Milk-Bones. So I think she likes the Milk-Bone treats better, but she likes them both.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. organic ingredients and a short list<br />2. dog likes them<br />3. scored, so that it's easy to break them in half (most of the time)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. more expensive<br /><br />That's the one con, right?

I followed some advice here and ended up with the dough overflowing, but maybe I did something wrong...  Anyway, I managed to get the just-starting-to-cook dough out of the machine and into 2 bread pans (that dough had REALLY risen!)and cooked them separately somewhat according to the directions on the box (since it was already partially cooked, and had an extra cup of water in it - and I did not put a pan of water under it while baking in the oven)and they came out looking unusual (very white on top) but were incredibly tasty!!  I'll second that it tastes a lot like a french bread.  Kind of crispy and chewy crust, very moist and fluffy inside.  Nothing like gf bread at all.  No one could believe how good it was!  I really think this would make an excellent pizza dough since the crust is so crispy and chewy.  Of course, these were the results of having it flop in the bread machine first.  I hope I can duplicate my results while avoiding another disaster! EXCELLENT BREAD!  Now, if only they could keep it in stock...<br /><br />Edited to add:  I've now tried this with less water (about 2 and 1/2 cups) and the loaf came out perfect!  I have also had my machine prepare the dough and before it started the baking cycle I took it out, divided it into 4, flattened circles (like pizza crusts), filled it with meat, sauce and cheese, and then folded it over and pinched the edges and baked it at 425 for about a 1/2 hour to 35 mins.  Mmmm.... CALZONES!  Absolutely delicious, crisp crust and very tasty!<br /><br />The main problem with this product is that it does not brown.  It is always white on the outside.

They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.<br /><br />Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.<br />But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it's deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we're all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of ""United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers""....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these<br />different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with....

They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a ""Potato Chip Diet"".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I'd like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I've taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn't like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!<br /><br />Flavoured potato PERFECTION!",positive,1,866

There are no discernible fruit flavors. It's a vague sort of fruitiness, like Vitamin Water Zero.<br /><br />I also tried it with my SodaStream.

The Weight Control tastes great and smells like waffles.<br /><br />One reviewer of this product was disappointed by the fact that when he compared the Weight Control version to the regular Quaker Instant Oatmeal, he realized that Weight Control has the same number of calories (160) and more fat (3g instead of 1g), but you need to analyze the products as a whole.  There may be more fat in the Weight Control, but if you look at the other components of the product, you'll see that Weight Control has fewer calories coming from carbohydrates (29g instead of 33g), BUT it has two times more dietary fiber (6g instead of 3g) and a lot less sugar (1g instead of 13g!).  More dietary fiber and less sugar is what you should really be looking for in your carbs anyway.  Weight Control also has almost twice as much protein as regular (7g instead of 4g).<br /><br />There is more to think about with your food than how much fat it contains.

It's gritty but not in a tear-up-your-skin way. That grit is supposed to help wash away dead skin cells and leave your skin refreshed and clean. I would have to say that yes, it does make my skin feel nice afterward.<br /><br />Where to use it - it says ""body and face"" but I don't really like micro-beads getting into my eyes.

The small bags are a bit pricey BUT they're not made in China.  My brother always insisted that we only buy dog food made in the USA when we had our three labs.  Now I have a beagle and a blue heeler with my guy, and we are always trying to treat them for good behavior.  I found and buy these at Petco.  The bag has more content than the usual packs of Freebirds, and they like them as well, but I didn't realize until reading other reviewer comments where they came from.  Filled with condroitin and glucosamine for the mature dog with hip problems (the blue heeler), I thought I'd give them a try.  Though I don't see any distinct improvement in our 12 year-old Sydney's hips, I don't see anything detrimental either.  They come to the cupboard after coming in from outside or a bath just as before and gobble them down like a kid with candy.  The China factor makes me a little uneasy, especially at that price, but I see no ill effects thus far.  I asked my vet today what she thought, and she said that they're probably fine as long as they're not recalled, but the laws in China are less strict about what they put in their products.  It makes me wonder if I want to risk my dogs being a recall factor if that should happen, so use your own judgement.

In the last two weeks we have had issues where the device wouldn't steam intermittently.  Everything was done exactly the same way.  No user error.  Then finally last week it seems the bearings (I think they have bearing) in the center colum broke.  The underside of the Baby brezza is dark - presumably from the grease in the bearings.  The device would steam, but the blade would not spin.<br />Then today, it stopped steaming as well.  About to send the product back.  Had nothing but problems with this since we got it.  $100 just wasted.  Wouldn't recommend it.  Extrememly frustrating when at the last minute you have to figure out some other way to feed your kid.  Products like this need to work, and work well.  They are after all for children and will be used everyday!  Not sure what kind of quality control this company has.<br /><br />(update after a couple of weeks of use)<br />The product does work well.  Yes there are some lumps but if you manually hit the blend button for a bit longer you can get a very smooth puree for your child.<br />The one other issue I have found is that the blade is a bit difficult to take off.  I have to pull it quite hard 40% of the time - hard enought that I though I was going to break the plastic.  My wife felt the same way.  So my rating of 3 stars don't change, however it is stable and good product and we do use it daily.<br /><br />Overall the product works.  However I did have one major problem.  The first time I tried to use the product, it would steam, and the motor would turn on but the blade wouldn't spin.  I called up Baby Brezza and it turns out they had a manufacturing issue where the belt had slipped off the cog for the blade.  They knew about the issue and immediately told me to remove the 5 screws from the bottom, remove the cover and slip the belt onto the cog.  All in all, it was easy to do and took all but 5 minutes.  However, the fact that you get a product that would not work right out the box was a huge dissapointment and my wife was really frustrated.<br />On the plus side, the lady at Baby Brezza did know the issue and was able to get me going right away.  First time I have had success with customer service with any company.",negative,-1,431

They taste like the inside of a Mounds Bar. Only 2 ingredients: shredded coconut & rice syrup. I have purchased the 20 pack box through Amazon a few times. One of the latest boxes contained bars that tasted odd. They were darker in color and did not have the fresh coconut taste I was used to. Perhaps they were in a delivery truck that was hot and the oil in the coconut started to go rancid? Anyway, I contacted the company (Oskri) and their quality department was great. They provided a return shipping label for the unconsumed bars and shipped out a brand new box of 20 bars plus some additional samples to try. I have read some other reviewers that said they didn't like the taste of the bars. It's too bad they didn't try to contact the company because I'm sure they would have sent out a replacement product. I did notice though that the nutrition information has changed even though the weight & contents of the bar are the same. The calories, fat & sugar have all increased (180 cals vs. 246 cals, 11 grams vs. 14 grams, 14 grams vs. 29 grams). That is unfortunate, and I will have to cut down on my consumption.

I heard about Xylitol from a naturopathic student, that basically, the bad bacteria in your mouth feed on Xylitol but they can't digest it, and the good bacteria can eat it, so they proliferate. I thought I had tried other Xylitol gums in the past and didn't like them, but I decided to give this another chance because I want a gum to chew after meals that is actually good for my teeth. I was pleasantly surprised at the Spry gum! It has a great flavor (which goes away pretty soon after chewing, but it's a nice shot of good taste), but the best part is that the gum itself has a great texture to it and continues to be fun to chew for as long as you want. It doesn't even turn hard after drinking water like most gums do. I am a medical student so I did a search of the research literature and the claims of Xylitol are more than proven. However, all of the literature and research studies explain that you need 4-12 g of Xylitol a day (no need to get more than 15), but the average piece of gum has .75-1 g, so you'll need to chew at least 4-5 pieces a day to get the dental benefits (chewing it only sporadically, i.e. once a day, did NOT show any dental benefits).

I cook with fresh herbs regularly and thought that I would give this a shot.  Overall, I am glad that I did.<br /><br />First, if you are looking for a fresh taste nothing can beat herbs that were picked as recently as possible.  However, there are times when it is impractical to pick or purchase freshly picked herbs. Also, if you are just looking for a garnish this blend with work well and taste better than it's dried counterpart.<br /><br />It is true that the herbs were a little stuck together when I first opened the box.  I stuck a small, escargot fork through the opening and they loosened up just fine.  I had no other problem with clumping throughout the life of the product.<br /><br />The Italian blend had a nice, bright flavor. The chlorophyll was still present and strong.  Again, no substitute for fresh but better than using dried herbs when the recipe calls for fresh (it's great in sauces, by the way.)  However, if a recipe calls for dried herbs you will need a lot more of this mix since fresh herbs are not as concentrated as dry.<br /><br />I have not used this company's other products but I plan on buying them sometime in the future and I will update this review then.",positive,1,238

This was clearly imperfect (only breast milk is perfect), but it was organic, and I didn't want my baby consuming chemicals.<br /><br />Everything worked out fine for about 4 weeks. Our son would spit up to some extent after almost every feeding, but we attributed it to HIM having some issues, not the formula. As he started to better ""communicate"" with us, we realized that he would cry nonstop during his feedings, which didn't seem normal. He would continue to suck, but would sob through his eating. It was heartbreaking. We burped him incessantly, thinking it may be gas, but it wasn't. He wouldn't sleep because he was so fussy, and nothing would calm him. He had a dirty diaper only once a day (sometimes even less), and they would often be harder than we would have expected.<br /><br />After doing extensive research, we started our little one on Gerber Good Start Protect. It contains only whey protein and not casein, which is known to create curds in baby's tummy (in ANYONE'S tummy, really). It also has probiotics (like breast milk). When we gave him his first bottle of the new stuff, he saw the bottle and started to pout, and once he started drinking, you could almost SEE the relief on his face. He did not fuss at all through his feedings, and he was instantly happier and calmer. My smiling, beautiful boy was back! After almost 9 days of naps of an hour or less, he got back to his regular 2-3 hour naps and better sleeping at night.<br /><br />While I want my son to have the most wholesome ingredients possible, I believe sometimes the way those ingredients are mixed can be a negative, and I think that may be the case with this formula.

After her surgery, the vet said to prevent the stones, she needed to be on Royal Canin Urinary SO for life. However, a year on the food and her small 12 lbs body (healthy weight) jumped to 19 lbs, which is obviously not healthy for her small breed frame. Her activity level did not decrease and there were no other lifestyle changes besides the food. Even though it prevented more stones, that much weight gain is really risky and dangerous, it could have lead to other health problems. Unhappy with my vet's suggestion to simply walk her more (she already gets 3 walks a day!)  I did my own research and spoke with a pet nutritionist (expensive but worth it). Well little did I realize that this food contains tons of fillers and inferior by-products! Main ingredients include pork by-products and corn grits! The nutritionist recommended that I switch her to a home cooked diet with supplements (multi-vitamin) and urinary health vitamins (cranberry, hydrangea, etc.) to prevent bladder stones and continue to have her urine checked at the vet on a regular basis. Two years later, she's lost the weight and has had no more stones! She also has more energy! Most of the time I cook for her and other times I give her Merrick canned dog food with her urinary vitamins.  I'm not saying this will work for everyone, but it certainly worked for my dog and I'm glad I didn't just accept this food as her fate and deal with the other health consequences that come along with being overweight. I would recommend that anyone with a dog who has issues with bladder stones to do their research and seek a second opinion about ways to deal with these health problems.

I bought a tin of it 2 years ago and have still not gone through it all. To prepare, just mix with a bit of cold water and wait several minutes for the flavor to develop, then enjoy with sushi or sashimi. My directions are vague as to how much to use and how long to wait because the can's directions are not specific. Reconstituted, it's every bit as good as tubed wasabi. I find that a teaspoon of powder is more than sufficient for one person.<br /><br />Make only as much as you need and right before you are about to use it. The chemicals that give horseradish (and real wasabi) its pungency are very volatile and will dissipate quickly when exposed to air (15-30 mins). Don't think you'll save time by making a big batch of it and refrigerating it until next time. All you'll taste is a coarse paste of green goop.<br /><br />Be aware that the product description is **WRONG**. This is not an all natural product.

The verdict: Huh? What kind of crummy coffee are the ***** rating reviewers comparing this to that it supposedly tastes so ""out of this world""? After the first cup (brewed using my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G71J6G"">Swissgold KF 300 One-Cup Coffee Filter</a> in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000REZVW6"">Trudeau Board Room Desk Mug, Brown Leatherette</a>, using the recipe I've used for every other cup I've ever brewed, I thought: ""Jeez, this stuff tastes kinda flat and a bit burned!"" I backed off the amount I used in my next cup, which slightly improved the taste, but then it seemed like it was a bit weak, and therefore intolerable. About the only thing going for it is that it is not bitter tasting.<br /><br />The container in which the coffee comes is neat, though -- a plastic-lined, screw-on lid topping a stylish can -- and I'll get some good use out of it for storing other items once I've finished with this stuff. But I'm here to tell ya that this coffee is most definitely not worth the lofty price.<br /><br />One more problem: This stuff is ground to a near-powder consistency. It tends to clog any drip filter as when wet it becomes like a lump of tar.<br /><br />My recommendation for a truly great, flavorful cup o' java: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007G96XO"">100% Colombia Supremo</a>. For nominally one-third the price of this illy stuff (I've even bagged it on sale at my local Safeway for &lt;$4 for a 12 oz. can!), you get a way tasty cup of fine Columbian coffee. The Don Francisco 100% Colombia Supremo coffee is still the best I've ever tasted -- at any price.<br /><br />'nuff said.",negative,-1,301

This tea leaves a tingle on your tongue and I think it goes very well with a spoonful of honey.<br /><br />I do think you need two tea bags for each experience, so as to fully intoxicate the senses and experience the magic of the ingredients.<br /><br />Caffeine Free.

The heat was also far short of what I expected from a salsa listed as hot. A little of an afterburn, but disappointing.<br /><br />I'll not be buying another bottle. The only reason this isn't a one-star review is that it is affordable and could be used as a base for a better home-brew salsa, but I expect to be able to dig in right out of the jar.",negative,-1,146

Although I love the flavor and texture of French roast coffee, it's acidity tends to wreak havoc once inside of me.  Given my (minimum) two-cup a day habit, coffee can be tough going, to say the least.<br /><br />The Puroast brand delivered on the caffeine, but I found the flavor to be a bit bland, both straight and with cream.  I generally like my French roast to be strong, sharp and over-powering (so as to awaken me with a jolt and keep me fully hyped up), but the flip-side of this is typically very high acid content with the usual medical complaints.  To achieve that same full sensory experience, I had to use a bit more of it- about 1.5 times the usual amount of grounds that I brew of typical French roast in order to achieve a similar 'kick' from the coffee.<br /><br />In passing, I also like to spice up my coffee with either 1) a little cinnamon and Kahlua (usually during winter) or 2) one part twenty-year aged rum, minimum two parts Grand Marnier, chasing both with a strong batch of French roast filled to the rim of the mug (a kind of after-dinner dessert on the weekends for me).  I tried the latter recipe with and without a touch of cream, and while typically the coffee tends to eclipse the flavor of the alcohol mix, with Puroast both the aroma and taste of the aged rum and the Gran Marnier came through right nice as my ever-so-sensible British friends are fond of saying.  I also found that for best results with the combo of aged rum and Grand Marnier, Nestle's Coffee Mate French Vanilla product provided the best results, which featured a smooth, even finish combined with a creaminess that was, well, positively orgasmic!<br /><br />In sum, this product is an adequate and satisfying entry to the coffee space, and I highly recommend it to those who literally cannot 'stomach' their coffee.",neutral,0,337

For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meats high on the list, flaxseed, good vitamins and antioxidants, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash.

I am not demeaning Senseo's quality, but I am certainly highlighting my preference for Marley Coffee. I will admit that when it comes to pod coffee, I do not expect much, and that's probably why I have stuck to only one brand; Marley Coffee, however, went beyond my expectations. I like my coffee strong; therefore, I recommend one pours no more than 6 oz. per pod for a strong flavor (this is coming from a person who drinks `straight' coffee; I never add other ingredients or sweeteners)). On a side note, there was no particular exotic/fruity taste to this coffee, but the overall quality met my expectations and passed the ""will continue to buy"" test.

I was scientific, as I read all Amazon reviews on extra bold coffees that received almost unanimous 5 star ratings, ordering 4 of them to try: Tully's Sumatra, Van Houtte Taste of Europe 100% Colombian (I never knew Colombia was in Europe?), Caribou Mahogany, and Timothy's Extra Bold Parisian Nights coffee. I have rated and tried them over and over and they always rank Parisian #1, Mahogany a not too distant #2, Sumatran #3, and Colombian (the lightest one) a distant #4.

Although I love the flavor and texture of French roast coffee, it's acidity tends to wreak havoc once inside of me.  Given my (minimum) two-cup a day habit, coffee can be tough going, to say the least.<br /><br />The Puroast brand delivered on the caffeine, but I found the flavor to be a bit bland, both straight and with cream.  I generally like my French roast to be strong, sharp and over-powering (so as to awaken me with a jolt and keep me fully hyped up), but the flip-side of this is typically very high acid content with the usual medical complaints.  To achieve that same full sensory experience, I had to use a bit more of it- about 1.5 times the usual amount of grounds that I brew of typical French roast in order to achieve a similar 'kick' from the coffee.<br /><br />In passing, I also like to spice up my coffee with either 1) a little cinnamon and Kahlua (usually during winter) or 2) one part twenty-year aged rum, minimum two parts Grand Marnier, chasing both with a strong batch of French roast filled to the rim of the mug (a kind of after-dinner dessert on the weekends for me).  I tried the latter recipe with and without a touch of cream, and while typically the coffee tends to eclipse the flavor of the alcohol mix, with Puroast both the aroma and taste of the aged rum and the Gran Marnier came through right nice as my ever-so-sensible British friends are fond of saying.  I also found that for best results with the combo of aged rum and Grand Marnier, Nestle's Coffee Mate French Vanilla product provided the best results, which featured a smooth, even finish combined with a creaminess that was, well, positively orgasmic!<br /><br />In sum, this product is an adequate and satisfying entry to the coffee space, and I highly recommend it to those who literally cannot 'stomach' their coffee.",neutral,0,337

It has become my #1 pasta because it's completely wheat free, and corn has a better glycemic index than wheat. Also love the fact that it's made with non-GMO corn. This is also one of the few pastas whose package directions give accurate cooking time - most pastas tell you to cook for way too long, but this is not overdone at all when you took according to directions - I usually have to cook it a minute longer, and I like my pasta almost hard. I find it more robust and wholesome than semolina or durham pasta and better texture than brown rice pasta, which often falls apart.  This keeps its shape and has that nice springy al dente feel to it.  It's great with a good bottled spaghetti sauce, fresh grated reggiano on top and some garlicky sauteed spinach mixed in - fast & easy & yummy when I don't want to cook a more complex meal. Love this brand much better than DeBoles. Great price, too. Everyone I've ever served it to likes it just as much as any store-bought pasta and some folks like it even more, as I do.

You get zero calories, good taste and no side effects.<br /><br />So... what's not to like? The price?

They are simple to prepare: just add boiling water and let sit for about 3 minutes (I prefer my noodles a bit softer and let them sit at least 5 minutes).  The bowls provide a generous amount of noodles to make a filling lunch.  The Spicy Chicken variety is my favorite so far (better than the Beef & Ginger).  The broth is fairly spicy but not too much for the average palate.  Along with the noodles, there are pieces of dehydrated vegetables as well as chicken pieces.  The chicken pieces taste ok but are spongy and look kind of disgusting; I have thought about picking them out before adding the water but haven't bothered.  As other reviewers have noted, the bowls are high in sodium; however, you can use less of the seasoning packet if that is a concern.  For the price, these noodle bowls are a real winner, and they have become a frequent work-time lunch for me.<br /><br />I should note that when I ordered then from here, the case was slightly crushed and about 1/3 of the bowls were somewhat smashed.

I feel for those people who got scraps, but in my 24-pack I received pretty uniform cubes of a VERY good size. This is, hands down, the best crystallized ginger I've ever had except for once... and that was home-made in Hong Kong.<br /><br />First, the chunks are just the right size to be tender and sweet without being too large to enjoy as a snack. The quality of the ginger is outstanding, with a deep, fresh flavor and just the right amount of sugar. The color is a light gold, and the texture lacks the fibrous strands of mature ginger that too much crystallized ginger is made from. So, they say baby ginger, and I can attest, it must be. Because of that, the flavor is strong without being an overpowering heat, but the heat is there. I'd place it on the mild end of the ginger spectrum, which works for me, but if you want fire this isn't for you. This is one of two crystallized gingers I'd recommend, and the other is the fiery one (Reed's), but this has the better overall flavor of ginger.<br /><br />This is definitely ginger for snacking; if you want to bake with this you could, but you'd definitely need to get busy with the knife-work. If you're looking for dried ginger, this isn't that either... this is fresh, tender, and sweet-heat ginger. For tea... I could see mashing a cube or two and making something pretty terrific, but I'd probably end up eating it straight. I'm gong to buy some of the baking cut (small nuggets) for ginger snaps now, because if they're using the same ginger it's going to be amazing.<br /><br />Bottom line: while it's possible that some people received a bad package with small pieces, in 24 packs I saw minimal variation in size, and nothing I'd describe as too large or small. This is fresh as hell, not too sugared, and the quality of the ginger is out of this world. If you like ginger, I'd find it hard to imagine not falling in love with this.",positive,1,368

I feel for those people who got scraps, but in my 24-pack I received pretty uniform cubes of a VERY good size. This is, hands down, the best crystallized ginger I've ever had except for once... and that was home-made in Hong Kong.<br /><br />First, the chunks are just the right size to be tender and sweet without being too large to enjoy as a snack. The quality of the ginger is outstanding, with a deep, fresh flavor and just the right amount of sugar. The color is a light gold, and the texture lacks the fibrous strands of mature ginger that too much crystallized ginger is made from. So, they say baby ginger, and I can attest, it must be. Because of that, the flavor is strong without being an overpowering heat, but the heat is there. I'd place it on the mild end of the ginger spectrum, which works for me, but if you want fire this isn't for you. This is one of two crystallized gingers I'd recommend, and the other is the fiery one (Reed's), but this has the better overall flavor of ginger.<br /><br />This is definitely ginger for snacking; if you want to bake with this you could, but you'd definitely need to get busy with the knife-work. If you're looking for dried ginger, this isn't that either... this is fresh, tender, and sweet-heat ginger. For tea... I could see mashing a cube or two and making something pretty terrific, but I'd probably end up eating it straight. I'm gong to buy some of the baking cut (small nuggets) for ginger snaps now, because if they're using the same ginger it's going to be amazing.<br /><br />Bottom line: while it's possible that some people received a bad package with small pieces, in 24 packs I saw minimal variation in size, and nothing I'd describe as too large or small. This is fresh as hell, not too sugared, and the quality of the ginger is out of this world. If you like ginger, I'd find it hard to imagine not falling in love with this.",positive,1,368

I wanted to see if it was less on Amazon. So here is a review.<br /><br />I get this because it has no added salt. And while I am not on a low salt diet, most doctors say we (Americans) take in too much. This is great tasting and not crazy expensive. AND ... their website offers two tips. First, while natural, it does NOT need to be refrigerated. However, that will keep the oil from separating. And THE MOST IMPORTANT is ... if you turn the jar upside down when you get it home, in an hour most of the oil will re-absorb back into the butter. This makes it very easy to mix the first time. After the initial mix, you can refrigerate and no more mixing will be needed.<br /><br />Normally I get two jars at a time. By flipping both upside down, after a day or so, both jars require almost no mixing because the oil has been totally re-absorb back into the butter.<br /><br />Their website says that you can take off a spoon full of oil, which makes mixing easier. If you do the flipping trick, I find that is unnecessary.<br /><br />Anyway, while I did not find this cheaper here on Amazon, I'm still glad I got to tell you how much I love this stuff!",positive,1,243

They are simple to prepare: just add boiling water and let sit for about 3 minutes (I prefer my noodles a bit softer and let them sit at least 5 minutes).  The bowls provide a generous amount of noodles to make a filling lunch.  The Spicy Chicken variety is my favorite so far (better than the Beef & Ginger).  The broth is fairly spicy but not too much for the average palate.  Along with the noodles, there are pieces of dehydrated vegetables as well as chicken pieces.  The chicken pieces taste ok but are spongy and look kind of disgusting; I have thought about picking them out before adding the water but haven't bothered.  As other reviewers have noted, the bowls are high in sodium; however, you can use less of the seasoning packet if that is a concern.  For the price, these noodle bowls are a real winner, and they have become a frequent work-time lunch for me.<br /><br />I should note that when I ordered then from here, the case was slightly crushed and about 1/3 of the bowls were somewhat smashed.  Fortunately, the bowls were not broken and did not leak; however, because they were uneven in depth, not all the noodles were submerged in water, so they cooked unevenly.

I was diagnosed with abnormally high blood pressure for my age about a year ago. On top of this I also suffer from extreme anxiety, nervousness, sleep issues, muscle aches, etc. After many tests, blood pressure medication and Zoloft, nothing really seemed to work. About a month ago I was getting a colonic and my hydrotherapist said that I was more than likely magnesium deficient. 2 days later I saw my urologist who diagnosed me (after a 24 hour urine test) with exactly that, magnesium deficiency. I went down to the local health food store and the clerk recommended that I try ""Natural Calm""; As usual, I was skeptical (especially with the $20 price tag on an 8 oz. bottle). Needless to say, I was willing to give anything a shot.<br /><br />I must say...this is a MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!! I take it 2 times a day (1-1/2 tsp. in the morning and 1-1/2 tsp. in the evening). This stuff gives me energy when I need it, all the while calming me down and 100% eliminating my nervousness and anxiety. I'm waking up in a snap and falling asleep even quicker (I stopped taking sleep aids). I have a great night of sleep and notice my body is requiring less sleep to achieve the same results. As for the body and muscle aches...those, too, have disappeared. I don't have to swallow Alieve everyday anymore to alleviate these symptoms because ""Natural Calm"" does the job.<br /><br />I've been taking ""Natural Calm"" for about 2-1/2 weeks now and am truly grateful that I stumbled upon this product. People at work, as well as my girlfriend, son, and parents have all noticed a change in me. Best of all, the change I feel within myself is amazing. All the little problems my M.D. couldn't iron out were immediately dealt with upon my first dose of this stuff.<br /><br />As for negatives to ""Natural Calm""...I see none. Many people have complained about the taste, but to me the stuff tastes fine; almost similar to Sprite, but with a hint of a sour citrus kick.<br /><br />All in all 5+ stars. ""Natural Calm"" will be a part of my daily regime from this day forward. If you truly have a magnesium deficiency, look no further...this is the answer.",positive,1,394

It's hard to find food with that much protein. We've been through the wringer for 3 years with our German Shepherd's food needs. He was diagnosed at 1 year old with IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) and even though he is on medication, we have to be careful because anything less than top quality food will give him terrible diarrhea (no matter how slowly and carefully we transition him from one food to another). Even some top quality foods will do it.Since we put him on Canidae Pure Sea he's had consistently firm stool for the first time in his 3 years of life. His coat has gotten more soft and glossy, his breath is good (for a dog), he's put on and kept on some much-needed weight. We are so happy! He's also a picky eater, but he loves the Canidae and never turns his nose up at it.<br /><br />A couple of notes for any dog-savvy readers: we ruled out EPI and protein sensitivities early on. He's on Tylan and Immodium for the IBD, and most likely will be for life. The vet said that no matter WHAT we do, he will likely be subject to bouts of diarrea.

""-- M.""",8.0,8.0,5.0,1315612800.0,Great cat food,"My old cat who died last year had diabetes because I didn't understand the basic principles of feline nutrition.  After he was diagnosed, I switched him to a canned food diet with multiple small feedings per day, and that was actually enough to get him off insulin!<br /><br />Although I would have done anything to prevent his diabetes, I didn't appreciate how unfussy it made him until he died and I got another cat.  The old cat would eat anything.  The new cat would starve himself to death before he'd eat something that doesn't meet his standards.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he's particularly fussy about canned food.  He doesn't like pate-style or ground foods - if I even want there to be a prayer of him eating it, it has to have shredded meat.  That's why I was so pleased to discover this brand.<br /><br />First of all, I love the ingredient list.  The foods are balanced and grain-free (so important!) and don't contain unnecessary chemicals or preservatives.  The only ingredient I'm less than thrilled about is the tapioca starch (used for thickening), but it's listed after the protein sources I really don't worry about it.  When I was first considering this brand, I checked out reviews for it on other websites, and there were a lot of people upset that some of the flavors contain menadione.  I looked into this, and it's a form of vitamin K which is an essential additive in fish-based foods because they don't contain enough natural vitamin K and it's required for health.  The controversy appears to be based in that it was banned for humans...after a bunch of babies died when they were given great big whopping doses.  Fortunately, the amount of menadione added is so minuscule that I'm totally comfortable with its inclusion.  (And since it's not present in the chicken-based formulas, and since I think poultry is a better staple food for cats than fish, he gets that much less of it.)<br /><br />Actually, the chicken and pumpkin flavor seems to be his favorite.  I was a little unsure of using pumpkin, since cats are carnivores and carbohydrates can have some bad effects, but it's apparently good for their digestion.  Since I rotate the different flavors, the possible consequences are really reduced...and since cats seem to like to barf just to keep things interesting, I'm pleased about any possible stabilizing effect!<br /><br />Soulistic's website also promises to use human-grade ingredients.  No by-products here!  It even smells like regular people food, which, let me tell you, is a welcome relief.<br /><br />But the best part: the cat loves it.  He doesn't refuse it, he's not even merely indifferent to it - he devours it.  I've tried every single flavor of the ""in gravy"" flavors (I haven't tried the ""in gelee"" flavors) and every single one of them sends him into raptures.<br /><br />Seriously, it doesn't get any better than this.  There's a canned grain-free cat food with a high moisture content and shreds or chunks of real meat and fish as the first ingredients, and the cat loves it.  There are enough flavors to give him variety, both in taste and nutrition.  I'm sold!",positive,1,530

It's especially good for cooking bitter greens like turnips or collards; the coconut taste helps cut the bitterness, giving a marvelous flavor to the greens.<br /><br />I've discovered a fantastic way to make healthy popcorn using VCO. I've tried the stovetop method in the past using olive oil, but it's always burned my pot. What I do now is put a great heaping tablespoon of VCO into my 10-quart Fagor canning pot, melt it at 390 on my induction burner, dump in popcorn kernels to just cover the bottom in a single layer, and put on a glass lid I have that fits the pot. Then I just follow through with the popping process, jiggling the pot a little to keep the unpopped kernels falling to the bottom as the kernels pop. I listen for the popping to slow, just like you do with microwave popcorn, and then just turn off the induction burner and let the pot sit a minute while the last few kernels pop. This makes a wonderfully VCO-coated popcorn that can be enjoyed without salt if necessary, or add just a little fine popcorn salt and toss.",positive,1,230

I had previously used several favorite brands/types of coffee and I ground them fresh for use with a drip pot.<br /><br />Keurig K-cups do not normally meet my expectations, particularly in the strength of the brew but I have adopted the habit of using K-cups for my morning cup to ""chase the fog away"" and the brands I selected for daily use were good but expensive.  This coffee I found as part of a continuous effort to try new brands, to reduce waste but particularly in light of the increase of the price of my favorite brand to ~$0.71/K-cup.  Since I drink a double 7oz brew for that first cup to get enough volume with the brew size reduced for strength, that works out to nearly $1.50 a cup IN MY OWN KITCHEN for a less than premium brew.  This San Francisco Bay Coffee is of more than acceptable flavor and is very nicely priced @ $0.38/K-cup with an automatic repeating order-- close to half the price of my former choice.<br /><br />Incidentally, after the morning dose, if I want more, I then have enough functioning brain cells to recycle used, washed K-cups using the K-saver stainless steel lids <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XRTDVS"">Re-use K-Cups K-Savers Stainless Steel Lid 5 Pack, for Use with Keurig Machine</a> and my favorite Vietnamese coffee which costs ~$0.20/K-cup.  This is the best brew and the least wasteful way but I don't have the patience too do it in the early morning until awake.

They say that you'll never know if something is good or not, till you try for yourself.<br /><br />Amazon took awhile to ship and it was delivered on a day I didn't expect it to, so that worked out nicely. Packing of the drinks was questionable, but I've bought things from Amazon before so that was no real big deal to me. So that was 1 Star.<br /><br />When I first took a sip, I noticed a difference it had from many other ""energy"" drinks I've had before. Lightly carbonated, is a big understatement to me. It felt more like a juice that would always be cold, because the way it has been carbonated made it feel that way. So I don't really consider it to be an energy drink at all. 2 Stars there, tasted better than expected and for 12 bottles, it is a bit pricey but to me, not a big deal considering if this is what I'm paying for, then I'll stop with those other cruddy drinks for these.<br /><br />The last star, over the period of maybe 2 weeks I had finished all 12 bottles and gave some to my younger siblings to try. None of them told me of anything described on the label to have happened to them, but they loved the taste of it. In my opinion, Bliss has the best taste so far and I have tried Sonic as well, and I wouldn't recommend that one. Maybe after the first few days or so, I did notice feeling calmer, energy-wise I did feel like I had more energy to do things that I wanted to around the house and at school. But not by a lot.<br /><br />Reason for not giving that last star. The drink is good, better than I had expected to be, and the price of $2.50 per drink isn't so bad at all. This is considering that most energy drinks now cost in the range of $1.25 to $2.25. So for a little extra, you get something better and isn't hidden in a can where you can't see what is actually in there, plus tastes great.<br /><br />Recently I've just purchased Neuro Sun and Neuro Sleep, so I'll probably end up writing reviews for both of those as well.<br /><br />All in all, Neuro Bliss, in my opinion, definitely is worth the money. But don't go into buying this drink expecting too much out of it, that way when you do try it, it'll end up being better than you what you could have expected it to be. Maybe it'll even surprise you.",positive,1,480

One obviously had no idea what they were ordering; the other wants crispy cookies.  Hey, I'm sorry; but these reviews do nobody any good beyond reminding us to look  before ordering.<br /><br />These are chocolate-oatmeal cookies.  If you don't like that combination, don't order this type of cookie.  I find the combo quite nice, really.  The oatmeal sort of ""calms"" the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut-type consistency.  Now let's also remember that tastes differ; so, I've given my opinion.<br /><br />Then, these are soft, chewy cookies -- as advertised.  They are not ""crispy"" cookies, or the blurb would say ""crispy,"" rather than ""chewy.""  I happen to like raw cookie dough; however, I don't see where these taste like raw cookie dough.  Both are soft, however, so is this the confusion?  And, yes, they stick together.  Soft cookies tend to do that.  They aren't individually wrapped, which would add to the cost.  Oh yeah, chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet.<br /><br />So, if you want something hard and crisp, I suggest Nabiso's Ginger Snaps.

It turns out that her problem was in fact due to corn and other fillers used in lesser quality dog foods (in this case, Purina One). Overall, this product alone made it completely worth the cost to subscribe to Amazon Prime for the extremely fast and cheap shipping, so for less money (as Kitty now requires less food, since she's more full from eating less of the higher quality food and we make sure to only feed her what the vet recommends,) I no longer have to drive to the store and pick up a 40 pound bag of dog food and load it into the back of one of my GTIs. So far, Kitty's been gaining weight and muscle at a pretty decent rate, in my opinion. (Over the past 2 months, she's gone from approximately 59 pounds to 67.5 pounds currently, and is quite fit and happy.) All this, is of course in addition to daily exercise, walks, et cetera, but her temperament lately has also been much better. On the lesser quality dog chow, she used to mope around the house every few days, but lately, she's been very happy, energetic and outgoing. She seems to be much less easily stressed out, which is great for her, as she tend to be a bit anxious, although an absolute sweetheart.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I could not recommend this or any other Canidae Dog Food product highly enough.

What I can tell you is about the packaging for the 54-count package and my experience with K-Cups, in general.<br /><br />If you opt to go with the higher count package, please note that it does *not* come in retail box packaging.  Sure, the K-Cups are the same but, you get a brown box versus several 'retail' packages.  This, to me, isn't a big deal in the least.  It's not a large box and I'd rather recycle one box than several smaller ones.  My point - if this is an issue to you, buy in a different quantity.  Secondly, the K-Cup patent is a great one but, unfortunately for Keurig, it's days are numbered.  While I've tried to grind my own beans and use a ECOBREW reusable K-Cup filter to get the same results as the Veranda Blend K-Cup, I've been unsuccessful in getting it 'how I want it'.  As such, I've continued to pay a higher price per cup of coffee but, in the end, I still think it to be worth it -- it's a very unique blend.  What I can assure you is that the prices per cup will likely fall off upon the expiration of the K-Cup patent.

Specifically, the ""One Star"" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.<br /><br />WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.<br /><br />Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.<br />But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it's deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we're all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of ""United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers""....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these<br />different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the ""Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum""! : )<br /><br />I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a ""Potato Chip Diet"".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I'd like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I've taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn't like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!<br /><br />Flavoured potato PERFECTION!",positive,1,866

There may be more fat in the Weight Control, but if you look at the other components of the product, you'll see that Weight Control has fewer calories coming from carbohydrates (29g instead of 33g), BUT it has two times more dietary fiber (6g instead of 3g) and a lot less sugar (1g instead of 13g!).  More dietary fiber and less sugar is what you should really be looking for in your carbs anyway.  Weight Control also has almost twice as much protein as regular (7g instead of 4g).<br /><br />There is more to think about with your food than how much fat it contains.

I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.""  I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br />Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.""  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same...",negative,-1,540

When they arrived, the cookies were packed so tightly into a box filled with canned goods that the outer carton was pushed out of shape right on top of where the cookies were - which carton was pretty battered on that location, as one might expect from an incorrectly packed carton.  Amazon, what is up with your packaging logic?  It's so weird what you do when packing things....<br /><br />Anyway, I figured the whole batch of cookies would be crushed.  To my amazement, only 3 of the cookies were broken (out of a pack of 4 bags).  I think that was a fluke really.  Anyway, otherwise they were fresh etc.  The only other odd thing was that these seemed to be different cookies than what I was used to.  They seemed to be thinner.  I've noticed since moving from the West Coast to the East Coast that a lot of products seem different here in various ways, so I figured it was either that, or maybe I was imagining it; but I don't think so.

I bought a tin of it 2 years ago and have still not gone through it all. To prepare, just mix with a bit of cold water and wait several minutes for the flavor to develop, then enjoy with sushi or sashimi. My directions are vague as to how much to use and how long to wait because the can's directions are not specific. Reconstituted, it's every bit as good as tubed wasabi. I find that a teaspoon of powder is more than sufficient for one person.<br /><br />Make only as much as you need and right before you are about to use it. The chemicals that give horseradish (and real wasabi) its pungency are very volatile and will dissipate quickly when exposed to air (15-30 mins). Don't think you'll save time by making a big batch of it and refrigerating it until next time. All you'll taste is a coarse paste of green goop.<br /><br />Be aware that the product description is **WRONG**. This is not an all natural product.

Secondly, inside the tea bag, you get actual mint leaves, not tiny flakes and dust. And because the tea bag has a more 3-dimensional shape, the leaves don't get crushed as much either. The flavor is absolutely delightful! It's very smooth and aromatic, no bitterness or anything unpleasant at all. Great night time tea or anytime relaxing tea! If you don't like your tea very strong, you can use one tea bag to infuse two cups. Also, if you're not that into hot tea, this tastes pretty good cold as well, especially if you add a little sugar.

It turns out that her problem was in fact due to corn and other fillers used in lesser quality dog foods (in this case, Purina One). Overall, this product alone made it completely worth the cost to subscribe to Amazon Prime for the extremely fast and cheap shipping, so for less money (as Kitty now requires less food, since she's more full from eating less of the higher quality food and we make sure to only feed her what the vet recommends,) I no longer have to drive to the store and pick up a 40 pound bag of dog food and load it into the back of one of my GTIs. So far, Kitty's been gaining weight and muscle at a pretty decent rate, in my opinion. (Over the past 2 months, she's gone from approximately 59 pounds to 67.5 pounds currently, and is quite fit and happy.) All this, is of course in addition to daily exercise, walks, et cetera, but her temperament lately has also been much better. On the lesser quality dog chow, she used to mope around the house every few days, but lately, she's been very happy, energetic and outgoing. She seems to be much less easily stressed out, which is great for her, as she tend to be a bit anxious, although an absolute sweetheart.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I could not recommend this or any other Canidae Dog Food product highly enough.

Also, the added sunflower oil is apparently less than 1%.  Nevertheless, this information should be listed on the web page.  Sunflower oil apparently reduces clumping of the raisins.  Personally, I would rather have clumping and no sunflower oil since I do not want extra sources of fat in my diet (especially ones that are high in Omega 6 fats).  The raisins themselves are nothing special....they are average in both taste and appearance.<br /><br />UPDATE #2:  After reading recent reviews on this product, I decided to check the Made In Nature website to see if sunflower oil was still being added.

However, I sent an e-mail about this to Made In Nature and got the following reply:<br /><br />""Thank you for contacting Made In Nature.<br />We are pleased to hear that you are interested in purchasing our products through Amazon and understand the importance of consumers such as yourself, to be absolutely certain of the ingredients used in products. Currently, we do not add any organic sunflower oil to the raisins, and haven't done so for the past few months. We are also in the process of removing it from the cranberries as well. Our ultimate goal is to have all of our products include only the dried fruit itself.<br />I hope this helps and answers any question you may have regarding the ingredients used in our products. If you have any further questions, comments, or concerns, never hesitate to reach out. Thank you for your support in Made In Nature!<br />Brian McQuillan<br />Made In Nature""<br /><br />As a consequence of this new information, I plan to order the raisins again.  If product is similar in taste to my first order (and if the product contains no sunflower oil), then I will increase the number of stars on my rating.",neutral,0,448

I had it down to Wolf Pup, Taste of Wild, and this Wellness Core.  WC was my last choice as I researched that some dogs can be allergic to chicken.  I asked the vet, and she said it's true, but she wouldn't say it's common.  She said to go with chicken and save the lamb and bison as alternatives IF she would become allergic.  So then WC became my #1 choice.  It's grain free which I liked.  So we picked up the food, picked up our new puppy and started the half and half with the dog food the breeder was giving.  After all the research I almost cried as I poured in the ""other brand"" (knowing how bad all the fillers/corn/garbage was in the other stuff).  So we only went two days with the mixing, then I went to straight WCore.  She did great (7 and half weeks at this point)!  Never had any digestion problems, never had any loose stools.  I am hoping for the miracle food that everyone is claiming that it will produce much better fur and low dander.  We've bathed her 3 times in one week (I know, a bit compulsive) and she has no skin problems.  She is a little over 8 lbs. now, and just moved up to about a cup a day.  So they do eat less than the typical dog food.  The ""other brand"" was recommending almost 2 cups while WC was right on track with what she was eating at 1 cup/ day (divided into thirds or fourths throughout the day).  So I feel a little better spending the extra money knowing that it's lasting me longer than the typical bag of ""other brand"" dog food.  Love that the ingredients are healthy!  The only hangup I had was a comment I had read that their dog didn't like it.  I wasn't spending sixty dollars to find out she didn't like it.  I called customer service and she explained I would have a money back guarantee.  So that sealed the deal.  Our lab mix loves it, and we haven't looked back.<br />Update:  She is now 9 weeks old and only needing a bath once a week.  She no longer has that ""dog smell"".  It has to be the food. :)",positive,1,385

The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored.  Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas.  He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us.  We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room.  The smell of peppermint was overpowering.  It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint.  What a rush!  The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry.  For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.<br /><br />I am now addicted to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63L8S"">Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea</a>.

I was introduced to it four years ago, through a local celiac support group.  It is a cup-for-cup replacement for all-purpose flour in your own favorite recipes.  You can even use it to make a roux.  In some recipes, I find it best to add a tad more flour or a tad more liquid -- but I can tell whether I need more of either as I am mixing the ingredients.  And, with some recipes, I do need to increase the baking time as gluten-free flours do tend to take longer to bake.  I use it for cakes, cookies, muffins, bread and breading for fried foods, pie crusts and other pastries, gravies and roux, waffles, whatever.  I have noticed that foods fried with Domata Living Flour do not absorb as much oil as foods fried with all-purpose wheat flour, so they are crisper and they reheat well without turning soggy.  I don't need extra gluten for pie crusts, but you can add a tad more xanthan gum if you find that it is not quite stretchy enough for your pastry recipes.  The taste and texture are equal to all-purpose wheat flour.  Baked goods may not rise quite as much as with a wheat flour, but I find that the cakes and muffins are still the same size as they were when I made them with all-purpose wheat flour.  I have shared this with many celiacs or those who cook for celiacs, and it has been a hit with each and every one.  One note:  if you are using an old bread recipe, remember that gluten-free dough has no gluten to be developed by kneading and does not benefit from the second rise that some recipes include.  You can do either without harm, but there is no advantage to doing so.<br />This is the one gluten-free flour I must have in my kitchen.",positive,1,323

So that's insanely difficult. With Cytomax, I can definitely keep up with the workout better. Without it, I find myself panting for breath.<br /><br />The good thing about Cytomax is that it is highly refined. When you pour the powder down into your bottle, you can see white powders in the air and you see fizzing in the water immediately. It is so refined. That means it mixes quickly. The only thing that annoys me is that even though it mixes well in general, sometimes you get clumping of it stuck at the bottom of the bottle. That's the only bad thing about Cytomax.<br /><br />The taste is brilliant. I have tried the grape, citrus, and pomegranate with grape being the tastiest one. Eventually, after using Cytomax, I do not want to use any other product. The dosage of Cytomax also decreases as I become stronger and could sustain myself longer without additional aid.<br /><br />Give it a try. You won't regret it.

If you reduce or eliminate either or both of those, you no longer have a ""cookie,"" but a sad imitation of one, generally not worth eating. Quaker has tried to make a better-for-you cookie not by reducing its evil components, but by adding other virtuous ones, in this case whole grain oats. This yields a cookie with whole grain and fiber to offset, at least partially, its less nutritious aspects.<br /><br />Let's look at the numbers of two very classic cookies. Three Nabisco Oreos weigh 34 grams, have 160 calories, 7 grams of fat and 1 gram of fiber. Three Chips Ahoy Chocolate Chip cookies weigh 33 grams, have 160 calories, 8 grams of fat and 1 gram of fiber.<br /><br />One of these Quakers weighs 42 grams, has 180 calories, 8 grams of fat and 4 grams of fiber. So you get about 25% more cookie for about the same calories and fat, and you get 4 times the fiber. If they were as good as the other two, you'd have a hands down winner. Unfortunately, this is where reality intrudes. They aren't.<br /><br />On the other hand, they're not bad at all, perhaps just a step behind the Nabiscos and Keeblers that we all love. If you're like me and have reached that stage of life where you need to be sure to get enough fiber every day, they represent a painless way to get about a sixth of what's needed. And you will feel like you've eaten a cookie and not a styrofoam imposter.",positive,1,275

The latter product had the following listed for the Nutrition Facts link:  ""Unsulfured, Sun-dried, Certified Organic Seedless Raisins.""  In other words, no additives are listed.  I thought that the Club Pack size would be the same, even though the Amazon description did not include a Nutrition Facts link.  Well, I just got my order today and the packages listed ""organic sunflower oil"" as an additive.  Also, it is disconcerting that the package does not specifically state that the raisins are unsulfured.  I will not be purchasing these raisins again.<br /><br />Update:  I increased my rating after checking further and finding out that the raisins are unsulfured.  Also, the added sunflower oil is apparently less than 1%.  Nevertheless, this information should be listed on the web page.  Sunflower oil apparently reduces clumping of the raisins.  Personally, I would rather have clumping and no sunflower oil since I do not want extra sources of fat in my diet (especially ones that are high in Omega 6 fats).  The raisins themselves are nothing special....they are average in both taste and appearance.<br /><br />UPDATE #2:  After reading recent reviews on this product, I decided to check the Made In Nature website to see if sunflower oil was still being added.  The package label on the website still shows the additive.  However, I sent an e-mail about this to Made In Nature and got the following reply:<br /><br />""Thank you for contacting Made In Nature.<br />We are pleased to hear that you are interested in purchasing our products through Amazon and understand the importance of consumers such as yourself, to be absolutely certain of the ingredients used in products.

Our ultimate goal is to have all of our products include only the dried fruit itself.<br />I hope this helps and answers any question you may have regarding the ingredients used in our products. If you have any further questions, comments, or concerns, never hesitate to reach out.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women.

Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same...",negative,-1,540

We have now purchased 2 more as gifts for other dog owners.<br /><br />It took our dog a day and a half to figure this toy out. At first she barked at it since she was frustrated that she could see and smell her kibble but couldn't get to it. After a few happy mistakes with pawing at it and watching us pull the rope, she caught on. Now it takes her 20 minutes to eat her 1.5 cups of kibble inside.<br /><br />Great Features:<br />- Durable and easy to wash Nalgene type material<br />- ""Rope"" is actually a flexible rubber stick, making washing/sanitizing easy<br />- Screw-off bottom makes loading up the toy simple<br />- Translucent bottle so you can see how much kibble is left<br />- Can hold all sorts of sizes of kibble<br /><br />Challenging Feature:<br />- It can sometimes take a few tries to get the bottom screwed back on b/c the threads are narrow. But, then again the bottom has never fallen off and the dog can't figure out how to unscrew the bottom.<br /><br />We had tried other 'treat balls' in the past, but found that they couldn't hold enough kibble to keep the activity going for very long. Other treat ball products were either to big or small for our dog's kibble, making getting the food out either way too easy (it fell right out) or too hard (it took a human with thumbs to get it out). Finally, the other treat balls were a solid rubber which meant in order to know if anything was left you had to pick it up and shake it. These were the kinds that we impossible to clean as well.<br /><br />We highly recommend this product. So does Roxxee, our dog, who still finds eating to be a fun activity.",positive,1,323

Not in a ""dressed in pink, riding around in my shopping cart spoiled."" Just loved and adored every day.<br /><br />Crockett does not play with rubber chew toys and is not allowed to have rawhide (for health and safety). He has figured out every treat-dispensing toy (of about 15) that we own. They only take him minutes to conquer. However, this everlasting treat ball is a constant challenge. The challenge is not in the replaceable treat ""caps."" The challenge is between the inner, triangular flaps in the center.<br /><br />The first time that we gave him this toy, we only put one treat cap (official ""Everlasting"" treat) on one end - you can put one on each end if you prefer. It took him about 20 minutes to devour - a record for any treat-dispenser. Pretty soon he taught us that he could now get those suckers out in 3-5 minutes. However, we raised the bar and started putting his standard treats between the flaps in the middle. It takes us and him a little work (we have to pry the flaps back with our fingers and poke the largest bits possible inside). It is worth it to watch him contentedly gnaw at this toy for up to 30 minutes. Changing the inside treat is the trick because each type takes a little different tactic - cookie-like treats require the lick-it-raw approach, hard, meatish treats need some good crunching, and dried, real meat (think jerky) requires just the right angle.<br /><br />In fairness, Crockett is not a chewing kind of dog. If it's not food, he won't put his teeth on it. So, the first day that he carried this into the kitchen in his mouth when I came home from work, I almost collapsed in surprise. (The rubber that this treat ball is made from is softer than most pet toys and seems more appealing to Crockett.)<br /><br />Stats: Crockett is a pitbull/kelpie mix and weighs about 40 lbs. He works well with the med-sized ball, but isn't a crazy-chewer by nature. He is good with his paws and will hold a toy in different ways to get it ""just right."" He eats like a cat (when he's hungry), but likes all kinds of food.<br /><br />Crockett and I both hope that this helps you choose well for your pet!",positive,1,398

If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.

That is important to keep in mind as I review this specific product.<br /><br />I have very fine hair. Any little thing will weigh it down. In fact, that's the one complaint I had about the first Clear product I reviewed (Strong Lengths) - I lost what little volume I had. I didn't want to lose the benefits of the sleek, shiny healthiness I found with Strong Lengths from Clear, so I tried the Strong Lengths shampoo and the Volumizing Root Boost conditioner together before switching to the volumizing shampoo. To be honest, I didn't seem much of a difference with that combination.<br /><br />Next, I switched to using both the volumizing shampoo and conditioner. I did see a difference in the volume of my hair, but it also became more fly-away and less sleek. That has made it a little harder to manage, especially with my new short cut. (I made the switch two weeks after I got my hair cut.)<br /><br />I really don't like to use other volumizing solutions other than a little hair spray. But, I think I would prefer those over the results I get from this volumizing shampoo and conditioner. I'm glad to have the set. I'm glad to have tried it.

They adhere to sustainable and fair trade practices, use organic ingredients when feasible, and base their tea formulations on sound research and knowledge.<br /><br />The brewing instructions for this tea are very important: ""For maximum benefit, medicinal tea must be properly prepared. Pour 8 oz. freshly boiled water over a tea bag in a cup. Cover cup and steep 10-15 minutes. These steps directly influence the amount of beneficial components that will end up in your teacup! Gently squeeze the tea bag to release any remaining extract.<br />Drink 3 cups daily, one cup before each meal, for up to 2 weeks, then pause a few days before resuming."" So, Weightless is a long-brewing pre-prandial tea...if you want it to work properly.<br /><br />Also note the following cautions: ""Cautions: Tea containing bitter fennel fruit and uva ursi leaf are not for long-term daily use without medical advice. Contraindications: Not for use during pregnancy, while nursing, or by children under 12 years. Side Effects: Teas containing uva ursi leaf may cause nausea or vomiting in individuals and children with sensitive stomachs.""<br />****",positive,1,355

And a good chocolate chip cookie can hit the spot sometimes, even for those of us who aren't THAT fond of chocolate.<br /><br />So the Chips Ahoy cookies here are a variation I haven't tried in their product line before.<br /><br />The cookie dough itself is about normal for them, not quite great but not bad, either.

There's a LOT of chocolate in there compared to any other chocolate chip cookie.  For me, it was overwhelming, way too much chocolate.  My 7 year old said the same, took a bite, made a face, and threw the rest of it away.<br /><br />But these aren't being marketed to people who don't like chocolate, so our problem shouldn't be an issue with anyone that purchases these.<br /><br />Chocolate is pretty normal tasting mass produced cookie type of chocolate, with a pretty smooth consistency to it.  Again, nothing to rejoice about, but if you like a lot of chocolate in your chocolate chip cookiess, it will definitely float your boat.<br /><br />They're about the size of a silver dollar, give or take, so they're not very large, but given how sweet they are, I think anything larger would be overkill.<br /><br />If you like store bought prepackaged cookies, these should be just fine, if not a little better tasting than most of the other options.",positive,1,341

They are all good quality and I'd recommend any of them.  You probably will want 1 jug for every 5 days of a cleanse.  It is possible that you'll need more.  I'm not an expert to comment on darkness or many other factors.  Here's my brief breakdown:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00271OPVU"">Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> - The sweetest of the 3 for sure.  It is also probably the thickest but still runny.  200 calories per serving of 4 tbsp.  When I put this in my lemonade for the Master Cleanse, it makes the lemonade sweeter than how I like it.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ENHSC8"">NOW Foods Maple Syrup Grade B Organic, 32 ounce</a> - Is less sweet when compared to Coombs but a little sweeter than Family Heritage.  Runnier than Coombs but these syrups are all a little runnier than grocery syrups.  200 calories per serving of 4 tbsp.  It provided the right amount of sweetness for the Master Cleanse specifications for a drink.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00248E980"">Family Heritage Organic Vermont Maple Syrup, Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> - Good quality and tastes sweet but definitely not as sweet as the other 2.  Didn't get the calorie info before throwing the bottle away but I'm figuring it's the same as the other 2.  I usually put an extra 1/2 a tbsp in my master cleanse lemonade to get it a little sweeter and curb the hunger.",positive,1,277

I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.

Canola oil cannot be used by US FDA regulation in infant food. (One research paper found higher levels of erucic acid in red blood cells of autistic children compared to non-autistic children, and there are many other well established toxic effects of erucic acid in humans and animals.

Soy milk, however, has much more protein. Aside from being hard to digest, I don't eat too much soy because of the anti-nutritional components; so I get my protein elsewhere.<br /><br />The chocolate flavor is really great tasting, too.",positive,1,217

The banana nut flavor is not overly sweet and there is a distinctive banana taste, almost a slightly burnt banana taste.  I love pairing a bowl of these cheerios with so delicious coconut milk and sliced banana pieces.  The combination of the three easily keep me satiated from breakfast until lunch.  I occasionally mix this banana nut flavor with chocolate cheerios for an even sweeter, exceptional treat.<br /><br />While I do not find the banana nut flavor to be overly sweet, one should not overlook that sugar is the second ingredient for this food and, the sugar content is relatively high -- especially for frequent use by children.  Four grams of sugar is equivalent to 1 teaspoon of sugar. So you have about 2 and 1/4 teaspoons in a single 3/4 cup serving of banana nut cheerios. With everything else your kids consume during the day, (chocolate milk? orange juice? sandwich with jam?), the sugar in this cereal may be high for frequent consumption. Kids usually need 1200 to 1700 calories a day. While there is no prescribed amount of sugar for a kid during the day, I have read that the calories from added sugar should be limited to 10% which, on the low end, would translate to 7 teaspoons of sugar and 11 teaspoons on the high end. If you child is getting 2 and 1/4 teaspoons with this cereal, your child has consumed a fair amount of sugar for the morning.<br /><br />When paired with fresh bananas, this cereal can be filling but if limiting sugar for your kids (or your own meals), you might want to use sparingly.",positive,1,285

First let me say, they are awesome. They have next to no processing, ZERO chemicals, and are very tastey.  Yes, they are hard.  What do you expect?? They're nuts!!! Nuts are hard!!!  The little pieces of the dried fruit they put in add a little sweetness but, they're still nuts and therefore crunchy. It's just like putting a handful of almonds in your mouth.<br /><br />In regards to the fat content, any health related magazine, doctor, and/or website will tell you that some of the ABSOLUTE best items to eat to help weight management and a live a healthy lifestyle are nuts and seeds.  They contain all of the good fat that you're body needs while hopefully, helping you stay away from the man-created/altered fats that destroy our cholestrol, hearts and general well-being. Just like coconut, high in fat, but one the best things you could possibly put into your body. Remember, everything in moderation.<br /><br />In regards to the size, yes they're small.  They are not a meal replacement bar but it is a decent amount of protein and good fats to satisfy you for a few hours until you can sit down and enjoy a healthy dinner.  While I try to eat 5 small meals a day, in my line of work, it's just not possible so I snack on one of these during the times I just can't have a decent meal and they get me through.  And have you checked out the price of nuts lately????  Any good raw nut costs upwards of $6.00lb, I've seen some as high as $18.00lb.  So, to have this bar prepared, shipped packaged and sold for about a $1.00 (just buy them in bulk, Costco is even cheaper) seems like a good deal to me.<br /><br />In regards to manufacturing, while I do wish they were put together closer to home, first and foremost, they are a business.  They have to watch their bottom line just like any of us.  If you do your research you will find that very few of the ingredients come from China (only some seeds and rice malt, I believe because they can't get them anywhere else).  Most of the ingredients come from the US then are shipped to China for manufacturing in a facility built specifically for Mrs. Mays.  Think about it.  If you can pay the same amount and have either 20 people or 1 person do a job, and those 20 people are being paid a good wage in their country, which makes more business sense.  Now, I don't like it, but I can understand it. Considering labor costs in this country, imagaine how much these bars would cost if manufactured here? And given the issues coming out of China recently, do you really think anyone manufacturing there would risk doing anything less than spectacular??? Not if they want to stay in business.<br />Check out their website for their safety and health inspection related info.<br /><br />What it boils down to is this, if you want a great little, portable, and extremely healthy snack and you're nuts about nuts, then you will love these bars.  Do we all wish they were made in the US, sure.  But barring that, they are a great product for any health conscious individual as well as vegetarians and vegans alike.

Yes. If you like the taste and texture of coconut butter, you will most certainly like this product.<br /><br />Does it spread nicely? Well, that depends on where you live and how patient you are. In cold weather this is a royal pain to use because the oil separates and hardens at temperatures below 76 F. The instructions on the label say to place the container in hot water for 5 to 10 minutes to soften the manna. Well, in my kitchen (room temperature about 70 F) it took almost a half hour for this thing to melt.<br /><br />I placed the jar inside a stainless steel saucepan filled with hot water that must have been at least 180 F. After 5 minutes the water had cooled quite a bit and yet the oil had not even started to melt. I used a blunt knife to try and break the manna into pieces. Did the same thing two more times. Finally, the fourth water change did the trick and the manna now had acquired a nice consistency, perfect for spreading, but at that point I was not a very happy camper.<br /><br />I wanted to use this as a breakfast spread and that's not going to happen, at least not during the week. I just don't have the time nor the patience.

I've found a way to eliminate gas in my younger sheltie - mixing the dry kibble with a bit of hot water and letting it sit for 5 minutes before feeding the furry kids.  For some reason, my younger sheltie's tummy finds this easier to digest and now he doesn't have gas at all.  Woohoo!  So now I'm able to feed more of this kibble, they get twice as much of it than they used to.  I think I've been feeding this Canidae Grain Free to my dogs for almost 5 years now, and my dogs have never had an upset tummy.<br /><br />By the way, buying directly from Amazon for this item says ""Usually ships in 3 to 4 weeks"", but 1-2 days after I order I'll get an update email from Amazon saying something like ""Good news - We're able to ship this sooner than we thought!  Your item will be delivered a week from the date you ordered.""  And sure enough, it arrives within a week of ordering.<br /><br />**Original review**<br />I feed my dogs the Canidae grain-free All Life Stages food (now called Canidae pureElements, I don't think Amazon has updated the photo or name of this food yet but the ingredients haven't changed) - why the Grain Free variety?  My younger sheltie has epilepsy.  Gluten and corn are possible seizure triggers, so I feed both my shelties a wheat, corn, & gluten free diet.  Canidae is only part of that diet;  I feed them 4 small meals a day - 1/4 cup Canidae Grain Free ALS, then a 4"" piece of raw turkey neck, then veggies for the last two meals.  The last meal is sometimes another 1/4 cup of Canidae instead of veggies.  I know, it's complicated, right?  But my dogs really do better on a mostly raw diet like this.  I still use kibble because it's the fastest way to feed them a meal first thing in the morning before I let them out to go potty.<br /><br />I've fed a variety of kibbles from the natural pet food shops, some with grain and others grain free, and when I fed them an all-kibble diet (Canidae or other brands) my younger sheltie had TERRIBLE gas, while my older sheltie had anal gland problems where she'd have an anal sac blowout at least once a month.  So gross, but that's why we covered our couches in blankets that were easily washed.  (Gosh I hope you're not eating lunch while you read this review.)  Anyway, I started giving them more raw food and the gas has disappeared and my girl sheltie no longer has anal gland issues.  Their teeth are cleaner too.<br /><br />I didn't want this to turn into a ""raw food is the only way to go"" preaching session, I swear!  But for my dogs, raw is better - it's easier for my younger sheltie to digest so he doesn't gas us out of our home, and it gives my older sheltie firmer poo so her anal glands work like they're supposed to.  Canidae doesn't help my dogs' particular issues like raw does.<br /><br />However, Canidae is a heck of a lot easier and cheaper to feed, and my furry kids certainly do love Canidae's taste, they inhale it.  If your dog doesn't have weird kibble digestion issues like mine do, then Canidae Grain Free ALS is a 5 star dog food.  For my dogs' sensitive systems, it's a 4-star food.<br /><br />The Canidae Grain-Free All Life Stages has a 34% protein level, which seems to do better with my shetland sheepdogs' stomachs than the higher protein kibbles.  I've fed another brand of grain-free kibble (Innova EVO turkey & chicken) that had 42% protein which was too high for them to handle even when switching to it gradually and only getting a 1/4 cup a day... 42% protein made their poo liquid.  So, I've stuck with Canidae's grain free ALS.<br /><br />I've also done a 50/50 mix with the Grain Free ALS and the Grain Free Salmon, the furry kids love it.  The Salmon variety smells like FISH, big surprise, right?  I try not to breathe when dishing it out, don't care for the smell of fish like the pups do.<br /><br />As I write this, Amazon's price is the same as my local natural pet store.  As much as I'd like to support local business, my local natural pet store is terrible (it's a long story), so I buy Canidae here on Amazon.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Chicken meal, turkey meal, lamb, potatoes, peas, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), lamb meal, ocean fish meal, tomato pomace, natural flavor, choline chloride, suncured alfalfa meal, inulin (from chicory root), lecithin, sage extract, cranberries, beta-carotene, rosemary extract, sunflower oil, yucca schidigera extract, dried enterococcus faecium fermentation product, dried lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation product, dried lactobacillus casei fermentation product, dried lactobacillus plantarum fermentation product, dried trichoderma longibrachiatum fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, copper proteinate, ferrous sulfate, zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, potassium iodide, thiamine mononitrate, manganese proteinate, manganous oxide, ascorbic acid, vitamin A supplement, biotin, niacin, calcium pantothenate, manganese sulfate, sodium selenite, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), vitamin B12 supplement, riboflavin, vitamin D3 supplement, folic acid, papaya, pineapple.",positive,1,896

I followed some advice here and ended up with the dough overflowing, but maybe I did something wrong...  Anyway, I managed to get the just-starting-to-cook dough out of the machine and into 2 bread pans (that dough had REALLY risen!)and cooked them separately somewhat according to the directions on the box (since it was already partially cooked, and had an extra cup of water in it - and I did not put a pan of water under it while baking in the oven)and they came out looking unusual (very white on top) but were incredibly tasty!!  I'll second that it tastes a lot like a french bread.  Kind of crispy and chewy crust, very moist and fluffy inside.  Nothing like gf bread at all.  No one could believe how good it was!  I really think this would make an excellent pizza dough since the crust is so crispy and chewy.  Of course, these were the results of having it flop in the bread machine first.  I hope I can duplicate my results while avoiding another disaster! EXCELLENT BREAD!  Now, if only they could keep it in stock...<br /><br />Edited to add:  I've now tried this with less water (about 2 and 1/2 cups) and the loaf came out perfect!  I have also had my machine prepare the dough and before it started the baking cycle I took it out, divided it into 4, flattened circles (like pizza crusts), filled it with meat, sauce and cheese, and then folded it over and pinched the edges and baked it at 425 for about a 1/2 hour to 35 mins.  Mmmm.... CALZONES!  Absolutely delicious, crisp crust and very tasty!<br /><br />The main problem with this product is that it does not brown.  It is always white on the outside.  And the longer you cook it, the more rock-hard it gets.  I missed crunchy dough though since going gf, so I don't mind it slightly over-cooked.",positive,1,333

I enjoy Rooibos on occasion and use it for chai when serving to people who are sensative to caffine.<br /><br />One important point about Rooibos is that it isn't technically tea it doesn't come from the Camellia Sinensis fmaily and therefore is considered an herbal.  It's a common mistake to label things which aren't true tea as teas, but a bigger mistake would be to label this ""espresso"".<br /><br />The only thing Red Espresso has in common with Espresso (aside from how you may chose to prepare it) is how it is ground.  When dealing with herbals and teas the more surface area that the water has contact with when you brew it, the more bitter the resulting beverage. With Red Espresso, rather than getting a sweet and clean tasting beverage, that you'd get from traditionally prepared rooibos, you get one which is much more bitter and sharp.<br /><br />I tried preparing this tea a number of different ways and found it took a lot to get the water to grounds ratio right. With only one exception I was never quite pleased with the resulting beverage.  The best luck I had with Red Espresso was to put it on the stovetop in water and then add chai spices to the mix, drain through a strainer and then adding milk and sweetner.<br /><br />I recognize people will turn to products like this for the health benefits, but I think they'll be disappointed with the experience of drinking this like coffee. For a much better coffee substitute I recommend Choffy which approximates the taste of coffee much closer.<br /><br />But if you're looking to give up your regular cup-o-joe for tea, this isn't the way to go. You'd be much better served picking up some Yunnan Gold or an Assam black tea, brewing it strong and adding milk and sweetener (if desired). If you're set on rooibos then look for the full unground needles to use to brew a much more pleasant cup.",negative,-1,350

This treat ball with one of the treats in each side lasted her days with hours of nonstop chewing until I would have to take it away for a while.  She loves it and so do I!  I will say, once there is only a little rim of the treat left along the side you may want to go ahead and take it away because I let her have it past that point and she sorta tore up the rim a bit that holds the treats in because she was trying to get the last bit out.  I think it will still work just fine though for hours more entertainment for her.  Great product!! By the way, for people who say it is dangerous or got destroyed by their dog here are 2 points to consider:<br />1. you should never let your dog chew on any treat or bone like this without supervision<br />2. yes this is a tough product, but some strong chewers will just naturally destroy anything that comes their way no matter how durable it is and that is something you should know about your dog.  If they are a very strong chewer then you should try products like this keeping in mind that it may not last very long.",positive,1,235

While many dog food manufacturers use real lamb - and not lamb meal - in their adult formulas, this is the ONLY manufacturer that uses real lamb in its Puppy Formula as well.  Hounds have sensitive stomaches and lamb digests best without upsetting their stomaches.  It also promotes a shiny, healthy coat while minimizing shedding and flakey skin conditions that are experienced by some breeds.  The food nuggets are small in size and appropriate for all breeds and sizes of dogs; the nutritional values are the highest or on level with that of many so-called ""premium"" brands - and better than that of some.  I have fed Premium Edge Lamb - both adult and puppy - to my Salukis for 12 years and heartily recommend it.  Read the order of ingredients in your pet's food; they are listed in the order of most to least included in the product.  ""Lamb meal"" contains ground bone and other waste as well as the meat itself; this manufacturer uses only the Meat.",positive,1,181

But I left it to my Australian Shepherds to decide on their own. During the first taste test, Kirwan, who will throw his head back like an alligator and eat anything tossed his way, crunched through the first one but was not interested in a second helping of these Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats. Pippin, who has a more discerning palette, moved his across the rug with his nose and subsequently abandoned it.<br /><br />This morning, I placed a treat on the floor for each dog, and Kirwan ate his without enthusiasm while Pippin again ignored his.<br /><br />Look, I love my dogs and I think Newman's Own is a fine company. But this product seems to me the result of overzealous people going to great lengths to make themselves feel good about what they are feeding their dogs. I cannot imagine the amount of farmland, energy, and resources expended to create these organic dog treats. We are really out of balance here with our priorities and perspectives.<br /><br />Perhaps some animal nutritionist blessed this recipe, the art department created the bucolic packaging, and the marketing folks carefully crafted the spin for this product, all to make us feel good about having these tucked away in our pantries, but at $4 a bag, this will be the only time this product appears in our house. Besides, my dogs, who actually like foul smelling foods and will gloriously roll in who knows what sorts of awful stuff they find, do not like these sorts of boutique fabrications.<br /><br />I really think a reality check is needed.

The second is Savannah Gold, it popped up big, nice volume and again almost zero unpopped or blow out kernels.<br /><br />Two varieties that are close seconds as favorites are: Autumn Blaze Blend (small, crisp, no unpopped kernels but quite a few blow outs) and High Mountain Midnight (some no pops, good volume).<br /><br />There was only one variety that I would not ever use again.  The Black Hills had about 4 times the quantity of unpopped kernels as any of the other types, the kernels popped up very small, it was extremely hully and some kernels burnt in the hot air popper.<br /><br />Orchard Blossom, Red River Valley and Harvest Blend types all popped fine in my hot air popper with only a few unpopped kernels.

This seems to be one of those things that wasn't even recognized a couple decades ago and now everyone seems to be worried about gluten. Gosh, I was at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market the other day and found that they even had a gluten-free section with all kinds of gluten-free products. I was amazed. I looked over the selection and decided to try a can of the Gluten Free Cafe Chicken Noodle Soup. I was very disappointed with the soup. First of all, the picture on the can shows an abundance of chicken and noodles. In reality, the broth is by far the main constituent of the can.  When you empty the entire can into a bowl, the chicken, noodles and vegetables don't even show. The chicken is somewhat dry, tough and woody and lacks good flavor. The noodles strike me as being badly overcooked, at least for my taste. The flavor of the broth is weak and the sodium content is high. Gosh, I had a can of this soup (not a very fulfilling meal) and took in about 60% of my daily value of sodium. I suppose this might be an appropriate item if you have gluten problems, but I don't. There are a lot better Chicken Noodle soups around if you aren't worried about the gluten problem.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",neutral,0,250

I used about 1 inch of milk, one spoon of sugar and the Keurig on medium brewing setting.  The same faint scent of toffee was there along with the coffee.  I took my first sip and hardly tasted any toffee flavor.  I looked at the k-cup and it said 'toffee' on it so it was the correct k-cups that were sent.  It is such a mild, almost non-existent flavor that I wouldn't hesitate to serve this to those who don't like flavored coffee, I'm sure they would like it.

Better flavors, actual unique flavors with each color versus just having different colors that taste all the same, and they are supposed to be hard. That's why I like them. If you want softer bears, you may not like these though. Mine were fresh, you can tell when they are not.. the outsides start to get harder/dryer and perhaps a bit white looking. This brand gets rid of that gelatin flavor that tends to be more prevalent in the cheaper store bought stuff.<br /><br />For the ones here, made in Turkey, that you will be ordering...Not super-sweet, really the perfect amount of sweetness. Good flavor profiles. Compared to the bears made in Germany, they almost have a subtle vanilla flavor to all of them, and the flavors themselves are not as potent. Honestly I love them both, but I suggest trying them both. You won't notice the vanilla hint without something to compare by, similar to having 2 monitors next to each other to calibrate the other.<br /><br />Now the goldbaren, which can be found online as well...  Their consistency, or level of chewiness, mouthfeel, is almost identical. The german bears use glucose syrup instead of fructose syrup, and have an extra flavor.. the green is actually apple. The apple flavor has grown on me since I've used up the bags I've ordered. My prefernce now leans towards the german goldbaren versus the ones made in Turkey sold here. The flavors are stronger, more in your face, and fruity. The Turkish ones are blander, with a pleasing almost vanilla taste to them that I do enjoy.<br /><br />Bottom line, try both, they are both quite good, but distinctly different as well. Buy both, or pick your favorite.",positive,1,310

My cat was self-feeding dry food (Purina Urinary Tract Health) which has a huge proportion of cereal carbs.  When she developed diabetes the vet advised adding Science Prescription Diet DM wet canned foot to augment the dry.  She needed less and less insulin and finally we were told she didn't need it at all. Still letting her self-feed the Purina dry foot while feeding her the wet canned, she had a relapse.  I decided to toss the Purina and just feed her the wet food and she's been fine for almost a year now.

It contains a lot of water (""no more than 78%"" is what the label says -- kinda expensive way to keep your cats in water ;)<br /><br />I justify the expense by accepting that my cat would be needing $100 vials of insulin, plus frequent vet checks of her blood.

What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends.

What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing).

I cook with fresh herbs regularly and thought that I would give this a shot.  Overall, I am glad that I did.<br /><br />First, if you are looking for a fresh taste nothing can beat herbs that were picked as recently as possible.  However, there are times when it is impractical to pick or purchase freshly picked herbs. Also, if you are just looking for a garnish this blend with work well and taste better than it's dried counterpart.<br /><br />It is true that the herbs were a little stuck together when I first opened the box.  I stuck a small, escargot fork through the opening and they loosened up just fine.  I had no other problem with clumping throughout the life of the product.<br /><br />The Italian blend had a nice, bright flavor. The chlorophyll was still present and strong.  Again, no substitute for fresh but better than using dried herbs when the recipe calls for fresh (it's great in sauces, by the way.)  However, if a recipe calls for dried herbs you will need a lot more of this mix since fresh herbs are not as concentrated as dry.<br /><br />I have not used this company's other products but I plan on buying them sometime in the future and I will update this review then.",positive,1,238

So many of my friends' dogs are sick with cancer and other diseases. Whay are they eatting...? I made the choice will you; or do you like to have your ears tickled?<br /><br />The Painful Truth:<br /><br />You really do get what you pay for when it comes to pet food, as illustrated in Ann N. Martin's book, Food Pets Die For. First published in 1997 and updated in 2003, Martin's book was the first to expose the ingredients legally used by pet food companies, including euthanized cats and dogs, zoo animals, roadkill, and diseased and rotted meat unfit for human consumption. Lest you think that what Martin documented isn't widespread, she writes:<br /><br />""In later investigations in both the US and Canada, I was to learn that the collars, tags, flea collars, and even plastic bags in which (euthanized) pets are wrapped, are not removed before they are shoved in the rendering pit. Deceased pets are being 'recycled' into pet food, and pet owners have no knowledge of what is happening.""<br /><br />* Poultry by-product meal. By-products can include: intestines, chicken heads, duck bills, chicken and turkey feet, feathers and bone, soy, cottonseed hulls, corn cobs, peanut hulls, citrus pulp, screenings, weeds, straw, and cereal by-products. Ingredients listed as beef, chicken and poultry by-products are not required to include actual meat. Rendered meat can be ANY rendered mammal meat, including cats and dogs. If the ingredient contained enough meat that it could be measured, it would be labeled as MEAT.<br />* Digest of chicken by-products. Animal digest is a cooked-down broth made from unspecified parts of unspecified animals. Any kind of animal can be included, and the animals can be obtained from any source, so there is no control over quality or contamination.<br />* Corn gluten meal. Corn gluten is a cheap by-product of human food processing. It offers little nutritional value and serves mainly to bind food together.<br />* Soybean meal. Soybean meal is a poor quality protein filler. The Crude Protein analysis on pet food labels is only a measurement of the amount of nitrogen in a food -- not the quality of the protein. Because of this, pet food companies can use the cheaper by-products of human food production, such as soybean meal, to boost protein numbers.",negative,-1,417

Okay, what exactly is amaranth and quinoa?  I've ridden a camel, been to a state fair and even penetrated Japanese prime ministerial security, but I can't say that I know what this stuff is.<br /><br />From the product page, it appears that the clusters are supposed to be little bite-size globs of vanilla blueberry goodness.  Unfortunately, when mine arrived in the Amazon.com book mailer, I only had two little cluster-like bits.  The rest was smashed and separated into bird seed.  I figure that clusters of this stuff would be pretty good, and make it a lot easier to eat this stuff ""on-the-go!"" as the package copy boldly exhorts.<br /><br />To its credit, the package opened right away, with the first pull, right along the top edge.  You'd be surprised how many packages can't get this right, like tortillas, beef jerky and lunch meat.  So, they had an advantage already.<br /><br />First came the sniff test: how does this stuff smell?  In general, it's kind of an industrial-neutral.  There is no cloying smell of artificial blueberry, which I was relieved not to smell.  There is the distinct and powerful scent of nothing but grain and seed, not salty or spicy, nor sugary sweet.  So far, the ingredients were in step with the package's copy.  There seemed to be just a hint of factory chemicals for the purposes of crunch or freshness or whatever.  I'm not saying that this is in the product, just that I seemed to discern that smell.<br /><br />So, I tried a third of this package in on-the-go mode, right out of the package.  Good stuff.  This would be a great product to bring along on a hike or a campout.  But, the bag's small size would make it awfully hard to share with any more than just a couple of people.  The taste was great, with very clear natural sweetness.  Very crunchy, but not that unpleasant brittle crunchiness you get with some foods.<br /><br />I then tried a third of the package in a little bit of milk, and it was just as good.  It stayed very crunchy for a good long time, all the way through eating it.  The density of it caused most of the product to sink to the bottom, so I had to bottom-feed with my spoon to get it all.<br /><br />Then I put the remaining third into some milk again, and sprinkled some <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOWJQE"">Equal</a> over the top.  Yeah, it was considerably sweeter, maybe even a little too much so.  Recommendation: do not sweeten this product any further.  Real sugar would make this stuff way too sweet.<br /><br />Taste.  The taste is in keeping with the smell, very grainy.  The taste of the blueberries is very subtle, as is the vanilla.  I could taste both, but it was subdued.  Overall, the taste was quite good.  Good texture, too.<br /><br />Nutrition.  Man, you're getting a lot of fiber here.  And there is a lot that this product doesn't have, as the package's front makes clear, like saturated fat, trans fats, cholesterol, etc.  That's pretty good.  But you're also not getting a lot of calcium, iron, or any Vitamin A or C.  While the package's front says there are no ""refined sugars"" in the product, the listed ingredients include official stand-ins/euphemisms for ""sugar,"" like evaporated cane juice.  The product's serving size is a miniscule 1/3 of a cup, and this comes in at 120 calories.  So, a single package, which I ate for dinner, comes in at close to 1300 calories.  Great energy food, but not great for a Saturday morning cereal bender in front of the Cartoon Network.<br /><br />Price.  The unit price comes out to be more than $5/bag.  That's something like more than a dollar more than a big box of cereal (truth be told, the big boxes come out to about 13 oz, and this product comes in at 11 oz).  So, you'll get considerably more product for your money with regular boxed cereal.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a good product, and I enjoyed it.  The taste and texture is good.  But, like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00317EA46"">Kashi</a> cereals, it's a bit too concentrated and a bit too spendy.",positive,1,704

If you are willing to add good cream to your coffee, then I would even venture to give this blend a full five-of-five rating.<br /><br />Before I even opened the package, I was hit by the smell of its contents, the strong scents wafting through every tiny opening. The smell, however, was of cinnamon rolls, not of coffee. Cautiously cutting open the container, I put it to my nose and was rewarded slightly by the previously noted sugary odor mixed with a very gentle smell of ground coffee beans (the package didn't indicate the date of their grinding, but, having received them for review, I assumed they were relatively fresh.)<br /><br />I have to admit that I was a bit concerned about using the drip coffee makers because of the fineness of the grind, but nonetheless I approached them hoping for the best.<br /><br />One of the first things that struck my attention was the fact that the instructions on the side of the bag indicated a measure of two teaspoons of coffee per six ounces of water. The standard measurement for gourmet coffee is two tablespoons per six ounces. (Although two tablespoons per six ounces provides too strong a flavor for many people, it pulls out the best taste with the least amount of bitterness. Extra water should be added AFTER it has been brewed to lighten the coffee to the desired level. NEVER decrease the amount of coffee to make it less strong!)<br /><br />To properly determine the appeal of the coffee to the typical buyer, I decided to prepare the beans two ways:  (a) via a high-quality drip coffee maker using the ""two tablespoons of coffee grinds per cup of water"" measurement, and (b) via a more standard generic  drip appliance, using its recommended ""two teaspoons of coffee grinds per cup of water"" measurement.  I first tasted the results straight (without any added flavoring), and then with cream.<br /><br />Using the high-quality drip coffee maker, the results were quite satisfactory. The taste of smoky wood was definitely there, and the flavor brought to mind fire-roasted beans, slightly burnt to enhance their essence. The hazelnut flavoring was more of a scent than a taste, lingering on the tongue and in the nostrils after the rest has been swallowed.<br /><br />Good coffee prepared correctly should never be bitter. Never. So I was disappointed to find that there was, indeed, a small amount of bitter aftertaste in the cup I drank.<br /><br />Also to my disappointment was a bit of a sourness that permeated the entire experience, like the beans had been left to ripen a bit too long.<br /><br />To my surprise, one sensation that was not there was the sugar and cinnamon that hit me so hard when I initially opened the bag. I can only assume those flavors were run across the beans to provide a pre-brew experience to tantalize the potential buyer, but they didn't make it across after the water had been applied.<br /><br />So, as stated at the beginning of my review, using a high-quality drip appliance the result was a pleasurable but not perfect experience, and a good start for my tasting process.<br /><br />With the initial ""pure"" tasting complete, I added some cream to my coffee. The result was wonderful. All of the bad tastes were washed away instantly. No more sourness or bitterness. Granted, a coffee drinker should not have to rely on something external to wash away unpleasant side flavors, but in this situation it produced a cup I eagerly look forward to drinking again. Five out of five stars for that experience.<br /><br />Next, I turned to the ""department-store"" brand of coffee maker and used eight tablespoons (the equivalent of 24 teaspoons) with 12 cups of water. The result was passable. It retained most of the flavors of the stronger brewing but in a watered-down state. Unfortunately, the bitterness and sourness - the two worst flavors - came out in full force. Judging purely by this taste test, I would give the coffee at most three stars.<br /><br />Next I added cream and, to my pleasant surprise, it again completely wiped away all of the unpleasant flavors, leaving behind a delightfully light cup that flowed smoothly down my throat. Once more, five out of five stars.<br /><br />I should note that I gave the lighter version (with cream) to a friend who generally does not enjoy coffee, and she loved it, going so far as to say it was one of the best cups of coffee she had had in years.<br /><br />I generally don't like flavored coffees, but this one won me over as a good attempt and something I'm happy to keep on my shelf. Again I wish to note that I am disappointed that the addition of cream was a necessity in removing the very noticeable bad tastes from this blend, but at least they could be removed, which is more than I can say for many coffees out there.<br /><br />""Black as the devil, hot as hell, pure as an angel, sweet as love.""<br />-- Charles Maurice de Talleyrand (1754-1838) speaking of the perfect cup of coffee.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brianna<br /><br />Footnote from Grey: I agree with Brianna's review.

I was so happy to find this product in bulk on Amazon (whether buying 12 7oz. boxes or buying the 3 3.3lb bags which is what I bought). Yes, it's a ton of mix, but I make this so often and it lasts practically forever provided it's kept sealed.<br /><br />The flavor is so far superior to anything canned and, dare I say, even better than refried beans made at home. This is mainly due to the extra flavorings added to the mix whereas home recipes usually only add salt and/or garlic. This product is perfect for anyone who loves refried beans and wants a convenient way to prepare them. I think it's incredible that something this easy and fast to prepare actually tastes better than something you can make at home (that also takes much longer). It's great for quick bean and cheese burritos or breakfast burritos (bean, cheese, and egg with some red sauce) and also great for campers. Plus, if you buy the 3 3.3lb bags, you can divide this product up and make as much or as little as you need.<br /><br />Preparation information:  Many sites I researched for this product said to mix 1.75C boiling water with 1C of mix in a bowl, cover, and let sit for 5 mins.  However, THIS IS INCORRECT and results in runny beans.  I contacted the good folks at Fantastic Foods and was forwarded preparation instructions which are as follows.<br /><br />Pour 1.75C boiling water of 1 1/3C of mix in a bowl.  Stir well, cover and let sit for 5 mins.<br /><br />I haven't tried this ratio yet as I just received the email and wanted to post a review including the instructions since they all seem to be incorrect everywhere I look.  If the beans are still too runny for you, increase to 1.5C of mix and try that.  I personally like my beans very thick for both eating plain and in burritos.",positive,1,365

I have found that almost anything I used with milk, I can use this instead. The only time I prefer milk is in my coffee, and even then I use ""Lactaid"", which is a lactose free milk. Coffee-wise, I just like the creamier consistency better and also the soy milk seems to break up in hot coffee.<br /><br />I use Soymilk in my cereal, both hot and cold, and it's a wonderful replacement for milk or ice cream when used in a smoothie, with some ice and fruit(or any flavor you want to add.) Works great as a glass of soy with any meal.A refreshing taste, that, after a while you may even think is better than milk.

NO cholesterol(this is always a big plus for me),30mg sodium 300 mg potassium, 4 gr dietary fiber and 1g sugars (not added but coming from the ingredients).

So I was determined not to overcook these brown rice noodles. I tried making two dishes. The first was a miso soup with brown rice noodles, which was really just broth with miso and green onions and the noodles added when it was hot. The noodles softened and puffed up, but I think I should of softened them in water and maybe rinsed them first. The broth ended up being a little starchy from the noodles, but it was pretty good.<br /><br />The noodles by themselves don't really have any flavor, they just take on the flavor of whatever dish they are in. So the rice noodles in miso probably wasn't the best idea because the mild miso flavor didn't really give the noodles much flavor. I also tried stir frying the noodles which was much better. I just soaked the noodles in hot water, for about a minute, and then drained them. They came out clear and kind of crunchy. Then I stir fried them with garlic, onion, salt, and coconut oil. I also added some vinegar and nama shoyu for flavor. These noodles came out crunchy and spicy and actually were pretty good.<br /><br />The nice thing about these noodles is they only need about a minute in warm water and then they can be fried or added to soups or other dishes, so they are fairly versatile. They are also gluten free and the brown rice noodles seem more firm than the white rice noodles. As another reviewer posted it does look like these noodles are made in Singapore.",positive,1,278

A few of these beans, for example, look like they were dried w/ tiny black spots from dirt or perhaps insects? Some might attribute this to the fact that these beans are a product of China and while I do not think that its origins are the primary source of the problem, it might explain in part the low quality of the edamame. These green babies are tasty enough although the punch of the wasabi is low. Texture is reminiscent of freeze dried food but more solid.

Secondly, inside the tea bag, you get actual mint leaves, not tiny flakes and dust. And because the tea bag has a more 3-dimensional shape, the leaves don't get crushed as much either. The flavor is absolutely delightful! It's very smooth and aromatic, no bitterness or anything unpleasant at all. Great night time tea or anytime relaxing tea! If you don't like your tea very strong, you can use one tea bag to infuse two cups. Also, if you're not that into hot tea, this tastes pretty good cold as well, especially if you add a little sugar.

I'm not suggesting that this product is bad (which is why I gave it 5 stars) but I share more of a concern than evidently the company does, as to where they are getting this fruit, processing it and shipping it.  With the history China has had with kid's toys/formula/etc in the past, let's just say we don't feed these products to our child.

My wife wanted to feed him the way nature intended and we were visited by a lactation nurse at the hospital. She advised us and said that if we ever had problems with obtaining enough milk, we might try Fenugreek, a supplement available at health-food stores. Of course, we forgot the peculiar name shortly thereafter. Well, my wife started to have difficulties a few weeks later in keeping up with the baby's growing needs.  We mentioned the problem to a young couple who had a recent child. The woman said she had the same problem and told us to get Fenugreek. She said it had worked for her. There was that strange-sounding word again.<br /><br />We purchased Nature's Way Fenugreek shortly thereafter. Strange stuff. It's an herbal supplement in capsule form, but the label doesn't say what it's for. I guess you just have to know. Evidently, it's one of those things that takes a certain amount of faith. Anyway, since we heard about it from two completely independent sources, my wife started taking it. Well, it wasn't a miracle. There was no immediate change. However, my wife gradually began to keep up with the baby's needs and has kept up ever since. Was it the Fenugreek? Perhaps. Maybe she was just adapting to the new baby. It's hard to tell. However, if anyone is having this problem, I'd say the Fenugreek is worth a try.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",positive,1,246

They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a lively blend of sweet citrus herbs and orange essences. Sweet, yet tart, this is a cup of liquid sunshine, radiating multi-layered orange flavors with exotic hints of spice and a distinctive floral finish. Wild, indeed."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Wild Sweet Orange as ""tart, sweet, smooth, licorice"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""oranges, roses, lime"".  This is pretty accurate, although the words give hope that the taste of the tea never quite approaches.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Wild Sweet Orange gets only four stars.<br /><br />****",positive,1,277

They called it ""hardtack"" or just simply ""tack"".  It also seems to be a Swedish staple food.  I grew up in Texas so it is kind of hard to find around here, especially the hearty rye kind.  One time I went to purchase a few packages of it at the local ""gourmet food and liquor"" store and the cashier warned me someone had returned it because it was ""stale"".  I told her that they must have been clueless, cause that's how its SUPPOSED to taste.  The stopped carrying it soon after.  I'll just have to start special-ordering it.  It's cheaper here, anyway..<br /><br />I've tried many other Wasa crispbreads and I always come back to this one.  Nothing compares to the hearty rye.  It has a very thick, satisfying crunch and a nice, bland rye flavor.  I eat it with anything and everything, or even by itself.  It's great if you spread butter on it and eat it with soup.  Other examples: tuna fish, cheese, lunchmeat, peanut butter, ice cream, salsa verde, chocolate pudding, Wolf chili, banana slices, SPAM, etc.  Be creative.<br /><br />It NEVER GOES STALE, so don't worry too much about sealing up the package.  I believe that's a design principle in all hardtacks (see wikipedia).  In my opinion, it only gets better with age.  In reality, there is negligible difference between the freshly opened package and the months-old package.  Same crunch, same flavor.  It's like bread, but without the possibility of mold.  Oh, it's also healthy and stuff.  Lots of fiber.<br /><br />I highly recommend the hearty rye.  Buy a few cases now to prepare for Y2012 :)",positive,1,285

But, ignoring other controversies associated with that store, one day a package of this salt sold by that store stirred my interest which led to the salt completing the last step of its long and probably ecologically-unsound trip from Australia to my kitchen.<br /><br />Here's the thing about Murray River salt:  Its pinkish flakes are fragile and crumble easily in your fingers.  It also seems to dissolve almost immediately on contact with food.  This is in sharp contrast to every other salt I've tried.  We currently have 6 or 8 other kinds of coarse-crystal salt in the house.  None of them can be crushed in your fingers.  They remain large, hard chunks of salt.  Yes, they represent other flavors than the Murray River salt, but there is something gentle and friendly about this salt.  I have a totally-unsubstantiated theory that this salt is better for your body than the hardened crystals of other salts.<br /><br />Our household keeps Murray River salt in a salt cellar (in our case a small lidded wooden bowl) from which it is pinched with the fingers (instead of using the traditional tiny spoon) and crumbled directly onto food on the plate.  For sanitary reasons, only a small amount of the salt at a time is put in the bowl.  That way the bowl gets cleaned frequently.  Frequent cleaning seems like a necessity when fingers, even washed ones, are the tools of choice for dispensing the salt.  Words to the wise: If you invite nose-pickers to your table, provide a salt shaker and hide the Murray River stuff till they've left.  If you have small children in your home, wait until they are grown and are draining your bank account at the safe distance of some far-off college before purchasing and placing this salt on your table.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that they use this as a finishing salt.  Our household concurs.  We rarely if ever add this salt to anything in the cooking process.  We keep Kosher salt and a couple of sea salts for most larger-salt-use cooking needs, like baking (which frankly seems like the only time one should add much salt to the cooking process).  But this is the good stuff for your table and the food you serve on it.<br /><br />The chain store mentioned above no longer carries this salt so Amazon is the logical alternative.<br /><br />Note that I purchased a 1lb bag, which keeps well because I live in a desert.  But next time I'll probably purchase a multi-pack of the smallest bags for a small amount more per unit weight in exchange for the convenience of having smaller packages.",positive,1,504

I bought two packs because my husband and I are trying a low-fat, low-carb diet and I had been craving noodles.  Before I prepared them, I found a very helpful review here on amazon that gave some great tips on preparation:<br />1. Drain and rinse in a colander or sieve for a minute to remove most of the fishy smell. It is there, but you can rinse it off if you rinse it well.<br />2.  These are very long!  Much longer than your normal fettuccine noodle.  You might want to take kitchen shears and cut the noodles into thirds.  I usually leave them in the colander and snip around the pile of noodles.  It's not precise but it's easy.<br />3. Dry fry it in a frying pan for about 10 minutes on Medium.  You will notice the noodles become more opaque.  When you aren't seeing much wetness (not really standing water) in the pan when you move the noodles around, they are probably ready.<br />4. It may not be necessary but I remove them from the pan, prepare the rest of the dish, and then add them at the end.  I saute them in the pan with the other ingredients for about 5 minutes.<br /><br />Possible Preparation?  Try some soy, ginger, garlic, and chili paste.  Then add some tomato spinach, and mushrooms for a nice stir fry.  Or, shred some roast, saute it with some carrot and onion, spices and maybe a little bit of red wine for something like beef and noodles.<br /><br />The verdict?  These remind me of ramen noodles but with a little more bite to them.  They aren't a perfect substitute, but they work for me. They satisfy that craving for a noodle such that I am not feeling deprived. If you're on a diet that does not allow noodles, or if you are just trying to cut carbs, I think you have to set the right expectations.  They aren't meant to be an exact substitute.  You have to eat them with the knowledge that you are looking for an acceptable substitute.",positive,1,356

I searched though Google, eBay, and Amazon till I found this product. It actually reminded me of a similar brand I used to buy in a Gourmet Giant Supermarket. While searching I was reminded that caviar ranges dramatically in price from thousands of dollars to less than ten for a few ounces. A friend recently told me about a cruise ship locker that held over a million dollars worth on every cruise! The best caviar I ever tasted was at a 5* Marriot hotel in downtown Copenhagen. I ordered their caviar salad appetizer every day during a week long business trip. So with that background in mind for me this product was well worth the $30 some odd dollars I spent with shipping to receive 4 3.5 ounce containers. I even purchased some fancy crackers, and real cr&egrave;me fresh to go with it. I prefer small black caviar to other varieties, and while this purchase wasn't the tastiest I have ever had, it satisfied my craving and more. By wife also enjoyed this treat and complained when I emptied one of the containers before she had her ""fair share.""

On Jan 1st 2009 I took out the remnants of the herb kit and planted the Salsa Garden kit.  This particular kit has several extra steps - plant selection, pruning, growth stabilization, and pollinating.  I will mention each in detail here to help others.  The herb gardens are the easiest - just cut off what you need as you go, once mastered you might find yourself wanting to try something else.  Salsa Garden and other kits like this - i.e. Chili Pepper, Cherry Tomato, Snow Peas, Green Beans, etc. - will require a few more steps.  These steps are the main changes for Salsa kit vs Herb kit.<br /><br />1. Plant Selection -  With the Salsa Garden, you must first make a selection of the plants themselves.  After several days of growth you will see the small sprouts.  There will most likely be more than one sprout in each pod - you must cut back to just one plant per pod.  There will be only 3 pods total in this kit - 1 pepper, 2 tomato.  There will be spacers to fill in the other pod slots, this will allow growth of these plants.  Plant selection is important, so make sure not to let those extra sprouts keep growing - doing so will eventually overrun your pod space.<br /><br />2. Pruning - This kit's instruction uses the 5th branch system.  Read that section carefully before your first pruning.  Then afterwards you will continue to prune throughout the life of the plant - to prevent growth to close to the lightbulbs and to trim wandering branches that are unable to reach the light.  Eventually those branches will die and you can cut them afterwards if you accidently forget to prune them earlier.  You will continually get dead leaves, especially near the base of the plant - do not fret, this will happen a lot as the outer edge of the plant gets more of the light.<br /><br />3. Growth Stabilization - This kit will eventually require a string or twine, etc.  After your plant grows big enough, the weight of the plant will eventually cause it to begin leaning over, especially after fruit / vegetables begin to appear.  Each plant will need a string to stabilize it to the light post at the back of the Aerogarden.  I personally used 3 nylon strings that I removed from a shopping mall bag's handle, similar to that of an athletic short's draw string.  You can also get twine or other thick strings, like yarn, from almost any hardware store, crafts store or supermarket.  Some other sets like Green Bean kits have their own support devices, but for the Salsa kit you must provide your own - so be prepared.<br /><br />4. Pollinating - This might be the easiest step... or possibly not.  As each plant begins to flower, pollination by bees or insects will not be likely.  As per the instructions, you must gently shake the plants to cause the pollen to move about and eventually end up on one of the other flowers.  Read this section carefully about how vigorously you should or should not shake the plants - in my oppinion, not very much if at all.  I tried this step and it worked fine for the tomatoes, but not the peppers.  After several waves of blooms appeared on the mini jalapeno plant still no amount of shaking worked.  Eventually I tried to shake a little harder, which didn't work and also caused many of the under leaves to fall off.  My advice - use a feather.  This isn't the most practical method, but it works.  When you see several blooms open at once, lightly brush the interior of the first flower - then the second, third, etc.  Do not forget to come back and brush the first flower again at the end of the cycle.  The pollen will stick to the feather then stick back onto a different flower - similar to the hairs on an insect's legs and body.  You may have trouble finding a feather - which I recommend using a very clean one at that.  DO NOT grab a feather from a your yard that came from a wild bird or from a farm animal.  You sure don't want lice or other problems in your house.  Try a crafts store or you can pull the feather out of a cheap household duster.<br /><br />My final opinion, the tomatoes grow easily and without much trouble except for the stabilization.  The peppers on the other hand stabilize well enough and keep themselves fairly self pruned at the base, but pollinating these bad boys can be a little bit of a trick at first.  Overall this was a fun kit and it produced all the way until the end, eventually I ran out of nutrients and decided to remove the plants.  If I hadn't, they'd be still going.  I got about 5 months of produce - which over time was a lot, but I only got 2 or 3 tomatoes at a time or 1 pepper at a time for lots of those weeks in between.  This was fun, but may not be for everyone.  If you mastered the herb kit, then this would be an interesting next step.  On the other hand if you had trouble with the herb kit, then you might want to pass on the Salsa Kit.",positive,1,912

The heat was also far short of what I expected from a salsa listed as hot. A little of an afterburn, but disappointing.<br /><br />I'll not be buying another bottle. The only reason this isn't a one-star review is that it is affordable and could be used as a base for a better home-brew salsa, but I expect to be able to dig in right out of the jar.",negative,-1,146

However, neither one of us goes out of our way to get Starbucks because we don't like the taste for some reason. If Starbucks is considered bitter, that is probably why.<br /><br />Review.<br />I would consider this coffee bold yet not bitter. It's definitely full flavored yet not over powering. Maybe that is what ""Crema e Gusto"" is specifying. The ratio of coffee to water for a Dunkin Donuts drinker is about 3/4 of a table spoon to 6oz of water. I accredit the smaller ratio to how finely ground the coffee is rather than overall strength.<br /><br />I drink iced coffee in the summer so even though it is January I had to try it. This coffee is IDEAL for making iced coffee because you can make it at 1.5 table spoons to 6oz of water and the taste is not effected by a little bit of ice melting.

Marley coffee could be compared to a strong brew of coffee house coffee such as Caribou but without the bitter taste or the hollow taste I find in many of the coffee house brews. The Marley coffee is very strong with that tingling sensation in the mouth but does not have the bitter taste. It is very rich and smooth. This is one of the few coffees that I would likely drink black because it lacks the bitterness but has a strong flavor. It is very likely the best coffee I have ever tasted. It is not cheap.

This Fog Lifter brand does not.  The flavor is perfect, no bitterness and the strength is even good at the highest setting on my Keurig (travel mug size).  I only add a little heavy whipping cream to my coffee and it is the best (if you have never tried ""heavy whipping cream"", give it a shot), you don't know what your are missing, yes, it has fat, but no carbs, no sugars.<br /><br />Anyway I knew these were not traditional K-Cup, but who cares, in fact, I think this design is far superior.  The filter material is a bit thicker than the normal K-Cup paper filter, so the fact that the coffee does not drip through a single hole, does not matter, the flavor is still great.  The only thing that would make these better would be if they came in resealable bags, but then the price would go up.  I either just cut the corner off of the bag, then seal it with a plastic chip clip, or lately I have been buying Davidsons Tea.  The tea comes in a large foil-paper resealable bag.

Okay, what exactly is amaranth and quinoa?  I've ridden a camel, been to a state fair and even penetrated Japanese prime ministerial security, but I can't say that I know what this stuff is.<br /><br />From the product page, it appears that the clusters are supposed to be little bite-size globs of vanilla blueberry goodness.  Unfortunately, when mine arrived in the Amazon.com book mailer, I only had two little cluster-like bits.  The rest was smashed and separated into bird seed.  I figure that clusters of this stuff would be pretty good, and make it a lot easier to eat this stuff ""on-the-go!"" as the package copy boldly exhorts.<br /><br />To its credit, the package opened right away, with the first pull, right along the top edge.  You'd be surprised how many packages can't get this right, like tortillas, beef jerky and lunch meat.  So, they had an advantage already.<br /><br />First came the sniff test: how does this stuff smell?  In general, it's kind of an industrial-neutral.  There is no cloying smell of artificial blueberry, which I was relieved not to smell.  There is the distinct and powerful scent of nothing but grain and seed, not salty or spicy, nor sugary sweet.  So far, the ingredients were in step with the package's copy.  There seemed to be just a hint of factory chemicals for the purposes of crunch or freshness or whatever.  I'm not saying that this is in the product, just that I seemed to discern that smell.<br /><br />So, I tried a third of this package in on-the-go mode, right out of the package.  Good stuff.  This would be a great product to bring along on a hike or a campout.  But, the bag's small size would make it awfully hard to share with any more than just a couple of people.  The taste was great, with very clear natural sweetness.  Very crunchy, but not that unpleasant brittle crunchiness you get with some foods.<br /><br />I then tried a third of the package in a little bit of milk, and it was just as good.  It stayed very crunchy for a good long time, all the way through eating it.  The density of it caused most of the product to sink to the bottom, so I had to bottom-feed with my spoon to get it all.<br /><br />Then I put the remaining third into some milk again, and sprinkled some <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOWJQE"">Equal</a> over the top.  Yeah, it was considerably sweeter, maybe even a little too much so.  Recommendation: do not sweeten this product any further.  Real sugar would make this stuff way too sweet.<br /><br />Taste.  The taste is in keeping with the smell, very grainy.  The taste of the blueberries is very subtle, as is the vanilla.  I could taste both, but it was subdued.  Overall, the taste was quite good.  Good texture, too.<br /><br />Nutrition.  Man, you're getting a lot of fiber here.  And there is a lot that this product doesn't have, as the package's front makes clear, like saturated fat, trans fats, cholesterol, etc.  That's pretty good.  But you're also not getting a lot of calcium, iron, or any Vitamin A or C.  While the package's front says there are no ""refined sugars"" in the product, the listed ingredients include official stand-ins/euphemisms for ""sugar,"" like evaporated cane juice.  The product's serving size is a miniscule 1/3 of a cup, and this comes in at 120 calories.  So, a single package, which I ate for dinner, comes in at close to 1300 calories.  Great energy food, but not great for a Saturday morning cereal bender in front of the Cartoon Network.<br /><br />Price.  The unit price comes out to be more than $5/bag.  That's something like more than a dollar more than a big box of cereal (truth be told, the big boxes come out to about 13 oz, and this product comes in at 11 oz).  So, you'll get considerably more product for your money with regular boxed cereal.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a good product, and I enjoyed it.  The taste and texture is good.  But, like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00317EA46"">Kashi</a> cereals, it's a bit too concentrated and a bit too spendy.",positive,1,704

Takes all of 2 minutes to prepare and another couple to broil and you are done!  I am delighted to find that Amazon carries it as it has become a major staple in my pantry.

The form I most often use is the shaker jar, the blend with FOS, from this same reliable company (Wisdom Naturals).<br /><br />But I also buy their product in tablets for the convenience. I take a packet with me for when I am away from home (travel, motels, etc).<br /><br />Another good reason for choosing tablets that I learned from experience:<br /><br />I was trying to get a friend to switch to stevia for his coffee instead of the chemical whatever-it-was sweetener tabs that were his habit. He reported that the stevia was far too intenseley sweet. I was suprised, but then after further dialogue, learned that it was because when he used the shaker jar, he poured in too much. Since then I found that setting a stevia-newbie up with tablets, and the simple instructions of 1-2 tabs per cup, it's what makes for the best approach.<br /><br />Note! Amzn's current price on these, less than $4 per pack, it is VERY good. I spent a lot of time last winter researching lowest possible price on this product. I really believe AMZN's price here cannot be beat -- particularly if you're calculating in the current promo of 20% off and free shipping.",positive,1,225

The first, Apollo, is quite enthusiastic about food related assignments and is usually most concerned about quantity.  The second, LJ, is more discerning about food, occasionally refusing to participate.<br /><br />When I opened the first selection, Chicken Pot Pie I noticed a quantity of liquid around the solid portion of the meal and was concerned that it was perhaps spoiled.  I detected no bad odor so I offered it to my panel, who were incidentally becoming quite impatient.  Apollo immediately began to consume his portion, pausing only when the dish was empty.  LJ took her usual cautious sniff of the food and then began to eagerly lap up the liquid, pausing to take a bite of the solids from time to time.  She too did not stop eating until the entire portion was consumed.<br /><br />At the next testing session I offered the Chinese Chicken selection.  This one looked much more like other canned cat food but had a more pronounced odor.  Both testers arrived at their stations without being summoned.  Again both testers were enthusiastic about their assignments and did not stop until the entire portion was consumed.  In fact when the testers were disturbed by two members of the canine food testing team they expressed great displeasure.<br /><br />As I was preparing the food samples a member of the human food testing panel remarked that the feline samples, particularly the Chinese Chicken, looked better than much of the food she had been eating at college.<br /><br />Obviously the feline panel was quite taken with the product.  Our chief accountant had some issues with it however since this product costs about four times as much per ounce as our usual offering. (Note:  usual offering has kept six cats quite healthy for more than thirty years).  With this price factor in mind I divided each single serving (3 oz) can between the two testers and supplemented with dry food.<br /><br />Due to the enthusiastic endorsements by the feline food testers and based on my prior experience with aging felines' diminished appetites, I will purchase this product in the future as a supplement to the usual feline menu offerings, much as the human menu is supplemented by holiday meals or upscale restaurant outings.",positive,1,388

Our two cats have been living on various ""high end"" dry cat foods for some time now (e.g., the ""Before Grain"" foods in chicken, tuna and salmon versions, and some fancy pantsy ""Duck a l'orange"" stuff from our local pet shop).  They have not been partial to canned foods, nor have I often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didn't seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food (and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods).  They typically start out loving canned food, but after a few bites, the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food they've grown to love.<br /><br />However, both of our cats are smitten by this stuff.  It looks like real food out of the can, with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened broth.  It doesn't have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something I could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch.  The 3 ounce size makes it perfect for a ""treat"" for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish (with some added hot water as they really love the broth).<br /><br />But I'm not sure I want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason I don't want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises, much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash -- I'm concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet.

I'm also left to wonder about the source of the fish and seafood in these cans -- is it farm raised in Thailand and if so under what conditions; is it wild fish that may be subject to overfishing and at the very least ought to be feeding hungry humanity rather than going down my cats' gullets; what about mercury and other contaminants in the food?<br /><br />Bottom line: my cats seem to love the stuff, but I'm not sure that will be sufficient to convince me to buy it again.",neutral,0,454

After the first cup (brewed using my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G71J6G"">Swissgold KF 300 One-Cup Coffee Filter</a> in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000REZVW6"">Trudeau Board Room Desk Mug, Brown Leatherette</a>, using the recipe I've used for every other cup I've ever brewed, I thought: ""Jeez, this stuff tastes kinda flat and a bit burned!"" I backed off the amount I used in my next cup, which slightly improved the taste, but then it seemed like it was a bit weak, and therefore intolerable. About the only thing going for it is that it is not bitter tasting.<br /><br />The container in which the coffee comes is neat, though -- a plastic-lined, screw-on lid topping a stylish can -- and I'll get some good use out of it for storing other items once I've finished with this stuff. But I'm here to tell ya that this coffee is most definitely not worth the lofty price.<br /><br />One more problem: This stuff is ground to a near-powder consistency. It tends to clog any drip filter as when wet it becomes like a lump of tar.<br /><br />My recommendation for a truly great, flavorful cup o' java: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007G96XO"">100% Colombia Supremo</a>. For nominally one-third the price of this illy stuff (I've even bagged it on sale at my local Safeway for &lt;$4 for a 12 oz. can!), you get a way tasty cup of fine Columbian coffee.

I have read all over the internet that this is a great beauty product, and really wonderful for your hair.  I started doing weekly vinegar scalp treatments (50/50 ratio with water) a few weeks ago, and I have noticed a dramatic decrease in the amount of hair that I'm shedding.  I apply the treatment directly to my scalp using a hair dye application bottle (with a small pointed tip), and then wrap my hair up in a towel for about an hour.  I then wash it out and style normally. I am not sure how it works, but I am now losing about 1/4 of the hair that I used to during my daily washing/styling routine.  I also noticed that my scalp doesn't itch anymore.  It was never a big problem in the past, but it is something that I have noticed :)<br /><br />I also started having acne a few months ago, and I went to my doctor, and he prescribed an antibiotic cream, because he thought it was an allergic reaction to something.  The antibiotic cream didn't clear up the acne.  On a whim (again), I applied a 50/50 ratio of Bragg's vinegar to my face at night on a cotton ball (I take off my makeup with this mixture instead of washing my face; I hate washing my face at night for some reason), and within a week, my acne completely cleared up.  Again, I don't have any idea how this works, but it has worked wonderfully for me.<br /><br />My skin loves this stuff, and I am so happy that I found it.

They say that you'll never know if something is good or not, till you try for yourself.<br /><br />Amazon took awhile to ship and it was delivered on a day I didn't expect it to, so that worked out nicely. Packing of the drinks was questionable, but I've bought things from Amazon before so that was no real big deal to me. So that was 1 Star.<br /><br />When I first took a sip, I noticed a difference it had from many other ""energy"" drinks I've had before. Lightly carbonated, is a big understatement to me. It felt more like a juice that would always be cold, because the way it has been carbonated made it feel that way. So I don't really consider it to be an energy drink at all. 2 Stars there, tasted better than expected and for 12 bottles, it is a bit pricey but to me, not a big deal considering if this is what I'm paying for, then I'll stop with those other cruddy drinks for these.<br /><br />The last star, over the period of maybe 2 weeks I had finished all 12 bottles and gave some to my younger siblings to try. None of them told me of anything described on the label to have happened to them, but they loved the taste of it. In my opinion, Bliss has the best taste so far and I have tried Sonic as well, and I wouldn't recommend that one. Maybe after the first few days or so, I did notice feeling calmer, energy-wise I did feel like I had more energy to do things that I wanted to around the house and at school. But not by a lot.<br /><br />Reason for not giving that last star. The drink is good, better than I had expected to be, and the price of $2.50 per drink isn't so bad at all. This is considering that most energy drinks now cost in the range of $1.25 to $2.25. So for a little extra, you get something better and isn't hidden in a can where you can't see what is actually in there, plus tastes great.<br /><br />Recently I've just purchased Neuro Sun and Neuro Sleep, so I'll probably end up writing reviews for both of those as well.<br /><br />All in all, Neuro Bliss, in my opinion, definitely is worth the money. But don't go into buying this drink expecting too much out of it, that way when you do try it, it'll end up being better than you what you could have expected it to be. Maybe it'll even surprise you.",positive,1,480

I probably would have liked a little *less* chocolate just so I didn't feel so much like I was eating candy, but I can't fault the taste at all, it really had a great blend of granola crunch, a bit of sweetness, and that semi-sweet chocolate taste that blended perfectly.

The general advice seemed to say 'follow the directions closely' and try to use a thicker, non-tomato based, sauce.  So, here is my experience:<br /><br />1.  Opened the package.  It smells of the sea - fishy.  The noodles themselves have no color, opaque.<br /><br />2.  Rinsed the noodles off in a colander.  The fishy smell mostly went away.<br /><br />3.  Placed the noodles in boiling water for 1-2 minutes.<br /><br />4.  Poured the noodles back into the colander.  The noodles are now a white color and hardly opaque, so to 'blanche' has a dual meaning here.<br /><br />5.  Dried noodles, per instructions.<br /><br />6.  Doused noodles in an Alfredo sauce.<br /><br />Took a bite.  The taste is fine.  The noodles are slimy and nearly impossible to chew.  Took a second bite.  Almost threw up.  Ate some veggies and tried again, with the exact same results.<br /><br />My wife had the exact same opinion.  We didn't want to traumatize the kid's with this, because it's hard enough getting them to eat the good stuff.<br /><br />What it comes down to is that the texture is just unbearable, it literally induced nausea in both of us.  The fishy smell I can deal with, it was quite faint, but maybe that plays a part too.<br /><br />We'll give it another shot, once we build up some courage or completely forget last night.

I tried 2 flavors and the overwhelming characteristic is sweetness. Some may like this, but I do not. The main drawback, though, is the flavoring is not very complex. What I mean is that there is a narrow range of flavor receptors working on your tongue when you drink it. Cast in this mixture of sweetness is a single flavor, it seems. It is not complex; you clearly taste just 2 things: sweetness and a specific flavor.<br /><br />If you enjoy drinking something that is refreshing and/or interesting, this isn't it. For example, if you add a freshly squeezed lemon and some sugar to your water, your whole mouth seems to pick up a range of flavors and sensations that leaves a slight, but satisfying aftertaste. The MiO, on the other hand, hits your tongue with a strong blast of sweetness and flavor, disappears, then leaves an aftertaste lingering on the back of your tongue of that vague, yet strangely familiar taste all artificial sweeteners seem to have.<br /><br />There are better ways to flavor water, I'm afraid, than this.",negative,-1,195

The regular version is Not Recommended","Lets face it - the Mexicans love hot food and generally know how to make a fine hot sauce. While the label (in small print) says ""extra hot"" there are many other sauces which are far hotter.  Think in terms of needing 5 or 6 drops for a bloody mary rather than spoonfuls when using this sauce. It is far from being ""extra hot"". I'd call it medium hot.<br /><br />Important: There is a significant difference between this ""extra hot"" variety of Valentina hot sauce and their regular variety. The easiest way to tell the two apart is the regular version has a light yellow background on the label and this one - the so called ""extra hot"" has a black background on the label. To my taste, the ""extra hot"" is far superior.<br /><br />Ingredients (as copied from the label): water, chili peppers, vinegar, salt ...<br /><br />Which chili peppers Valentina used is unknown, yet the company has certainly created a nice blend. You can easily detect some sweetness in this sauce and that has to be due to a nice blend of the chiles. There are no added sugars!<br /><br />Normally I don't like any vinegar in a hot sauce, yet I don't mind it all in this particular version of Valentina. The difference may be this sauce uses actual vinegar while most others use acetic acid (a chemical component of vinegar) and the chili peppers dominate in this particular variety of Valentina. I want to emphasize that this is ONLY true for this particular blend.<br /><br />The bottom line is this is a nicely blended hot sauce worthy of your consideration. My four star rating means this is a very good hot sauce but, depending on your palette, you might find a few that are better.<br /><br />Warning: there is a significant differences between the regular Valentina and the ""extra hot"" (black label) variety that I'm reviewing here. In the regular version a heavy taste of vinegar is painfully evident while the ""extra hot"" variety is much better balanced, ie, the vinegar is in the background. So it is quite important that you choose the extra hot version - the one with a black background on the label.<br /><br />This is a near perfect hot sauce for a bloody mary and most other foods.<br /><br />BTW: Watch out for sellers that price the sauce low but charge very high shipping charges on a per bottle basis",positive,1,409

Do your research!,"This is a really good choice for a nutritionally sound, lower calorie food, and our cat (admittedly not picky) immediately devoured it. But the real message here is: you need to find out how many kcal/day your cat needs for weight loss, research the calories in your cat's food, and accurately measure your feeding. There do not appear to be industry standards for what's labeled as 'weight management', 'light' etc., and the differences are dramatic!<br /><br />Our very young and energetic cat starting piling on weight from when he was a kitten. Maybe he stuffs himself because he's a 'rescue'--I don't know whether he might have had some starvation in his early weeks that marked him for life! but we had to put him on adult food before his kitten year was up, on the advice of our veterinarian--and he went on to gain weight up to almost 20 lb. even when giving the recommended daily amount of food, measured, divided into 2 daily feedings.<br /><br />We decided to switch from a Purina Pro Plan regular adult formula to their 'weight management' formula--still, kitty was gaining. When I finally did the research of how many kcal/day he should be getting and how many kcal we were giving him (mind you--the recommended, measured amount), I was shocked. The packaging recommends 56-84 g./day of the food for weight loss, for a cat with a goal weight of 10-14 lbs. That's 214-321 calories, measured by their own nutrition information. But my research at [...] showed that the recommended amount should be 187 calories/day for weight loss, for a goal weight of 10-12 lb. That means the *minimum* amount recommended by the Purina label was 27 more calories/day than he should be getting--or 14% more! and the maximum 'recommended' amount was 72% more than he should be getting for weight loss.<br /><br />[...] has a publication with calorie counts/cup of a wide variety of cat food: [...]<br />The range of calories/up is staggering. Anyone with an overweight cat--do your cat a favor and research how many calories/day they *should* be getting, and how many calories the 'recommended' amount that you're feeding actually is.<br /><br />After finding out how much of the Pro Plan Weight Management per day to offer, I thought our problems were over--I started giving him a daily amount with the right calories for weight loss. And he did start losing, at a slow but safe rate: about .2 lb/week. But he was constantly, frantically hungry. I looked further, for a nutritionally sound food that could give him more volume and fill him up while still not exceeding the calories he would need for weight loss. With the help of [...] for nutritional ratings, and the calorie chart on [...], I selected Science Diet Light--with approximately 75% of the calories per cup compared to the Purina Pro Plan. I can now give him 9g/day more, and I think the higher fiber content of this food will help him feel more full. While it does cost more than his previous food, the difference is not going to break the bank--I estimate it will cost me $4 more per month.",positive,1,526

Alas, once again, Emerald has managed to just miss the mark.<br />I like only enough salt in my food to enhance the taste, and the fact of the matter is that cashews are flavorful enough that not a whole lot is necessary. These nuts--which are nice and crisp and unbroken, no problem there--could easily lose 75% of their added salt and they'd be great, especially given that the black pepper used is of pretty good quality and kinda kicks in after everything has been eaten...if you can refrain from gulping your beverage of choice to slake the salt-induced thirst, that is. There's also some onion powder added, which would be a good thing if it were only discernible. But it's not because of the salt.<br />The lion's share of the nutritional data peeled off when I opened the canister, so I'm not able to provide them (I think I can be forgiven for not rifling through the garbage). Cashews are relatively low in fat for nuts, but they're not a low-cal food by any stretch of the imagination, plus these are roasted in peanut oil as well. I personally think nuts, plain or flavored, are a great source of nutrition but only if I can actually taste them.<br />In my experience, the single ingredient most common to mass-produced foods is salt, which seems a shame to me, especially since its misuse is so unhealthful. It's a lot easier to add salt to a dish than remove it, so if you're interested in actually tasting your food (and I think even simple, inexpensive food should and can be wonderful), let the manufacturers know.

Bleah.  These cookie things aren't really anything to write home...or Amazon...about.  The cookies, or 'thins', are about the size of an arrowroot biscuit, but less satisfying.  There are 3 in a serving size, packing 5 grams of fat and 140 calories.  For 5 grams of fat I either want something yummy enough to be worth it, or filling enough to make me believe I just consumed 5 grams of fat (some of which is saturated).  So this is not a snack to hold you over between meals, dieters.  I suppose the 8 grams of whole grains are attractive, but that just translates into 21 grams of carbs and only 2 grams of fiber.  So this is not really a healthy fiber treat either.  Now you might say that this isn't a health food, so I shouldn't be judging, but by calling them 'thins', Nabisco is looking to aim at the dieting market.<br /><br />I guess I was hoping for something more chewy than crunchy.  Unfortunately, the 'chewy' is the little bits of fig scattered throughout the cookie.  So little and chewy, in fact, that they get stuck in your teeth and have you uncomfortably nomming around like a dog with peanut butter on his tongue.  The fig and honey variety had a taste and consistency somewhat reminiscent of a graham cracker, but a little drier.<br /><br />So I'm not a fan of these, and I probably wouldn't buy them while roaming around the grocery store, but I'm giving them 3 stars on the strength of Newtons *other* fruit products, the Fig Newtons and the Newtons Fruit Crisps.

Low Quality.,"Fortunately, I've never been gluten sensitive, at least as far as I know, but I've got a couple friends that are on gluten-free diets. This seems to be one of those things that wasn't even recognized a couple decades ago and now everyone seems to be worried about gluten. Gosh, I was at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market the other day and found that they even had a gluten-free section with all kinds of gluten-free products. I was amazed. I looked over the selection and decided to try a can of the Gluten Free Cafe Chicken Noodle Soup. I was very disappointed with the soup. First of all, the picture on the can shows an abundance of chicken and noodles. In reality, the broth is by far the main constituent of the can.  When you empty the entire can into a bowl, the chicken, noodles and vegetables don't even show. The chicken is somewhat dry, tough and woody and lacks good flavor. The noodles strike me as being badly overcooked, at least for my taste. The flavor of the broth is weak and the sodium content is high. Gosh, I had a can of this soup (not a very fulfilling meal) and took in about 60% of my daily value of sodium. I suppose this might be an appropriate item if you have gluten problems, but I don't. There are a lot better Chicken Noodle soups around if you aren't worried about the gluten problem.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",neutral,0,250

I make lattes 2 times a day and always use Starbucks coffee beans fresh and kept in the freezer until use. From the day it arrived, this machine made horrible coffee... but since I ordered it from Amazon and spent over 800 after shipping on it I decided to give it a while to see if I could get it to work better. I adjusted the grind, and the dose and tried over and over. What I found is that the espresso was very inconsistent, the red error light would go off multiple times during use. Sometimes it would make a somewhat decent shot of espresso and then I would adjust nothing and the next time it would shoot out watery crap, or it would drip out half a shot and stop. It has been so infuriating. Finally after a month I called customer service to complain they told me I should be priming the pump with each use of the machine... which I tried, for about 2 cups I thought it was fixed then I was back to square one.

I've done quite a few fancy ad-hock rice dishes, putting together anything I like in my Zojirushi and Cuckoo rice makers.  Recently, I got interested in making authentic Spanish Paellas.<br /><br />The first thing I discovered was that the ingredients are expensive.  Real Spanish saffron, Spanish Chorizo, and Spanish Paprika are rare and expensive items even in Los Angeles California.  Rabbit isn't easy to find either.  Nevertheless, I went through with the program and decided to build and authentic Paella.  After watching a plethora of YouTube videos, Pau Gasol on local TV, two episodes of Tyler's Ultimate, and one episode of Good Eats, I felt I had a grasp on the essentials.<br /><br />One thing the Spaniards stress: You can fool around with a lot of ingredients, but there are three things you cannot compromise on (1) authentic and pure Saffron, (2) Calisparra Bomba from Valencia, (3) real smoky-hot Paprika from Spain, (4) Good extra-virgin olive oil.  You also need to use an authentic high-carbon steel Paella.  These are quite inexpensive.  I got a fully legit one from Valencia (import duty tag and everything) for just $20 bucks.  I also gathered that I should use chicken thighs, rabbit meat, and chicken stock for fluid.<br /><br />To make a long story short I purchased a 5 pack of this very expensive rice wondering if it was going to live up to the praises heaped up to the heavens upon it.  Chefs called this the rock-n-roll star of the rice world.  They called it the Rolls Royce of Rice.  They said it was unbeatable.  I was more than skeptical.  I have eaten a lot of rice in my life--a thousand pounds or more by now--and I've tried a lot of different types.  They're all different in one way or another but they are all good.<br /><br />According to the poop-sheets, Bomba is absolutely unique because of it's ability to absorb 3x its mass in fluid, yet it never gets sticky or sloppy. It's hard to overcook.  I've made a lot of rice with a lot of varieties of rice.  All of them call for 2:1 ratio of fluid to rice, never 3:1.  All sources said 3:1 when you use Bomba.  Bomba is more delicious because it absorbs 50% more fluids, and 50% more flavors (measure for measure) than any other form of rice<br /><br />To make a long story short, I made my first authentic Spanish Paella 2 days ago.  It blew my brains out, and I don't say that lightly.  I've had a bunch of delicious rice dishes in my time, but this beat them all.  This was like a revelation from God.  I can see why many serious-minded gourmet chefs like Alton Brown, Tyler Florence, Guy Fieri, Paula Dean et al, obsess about getting this dish done right.  It's pretty frickin' stunning; a flavor explosion.<br /><br />Bomba is delicious rice.  I've eaten a lot of rice, but this one is making me forget about the rest.",positive,1,510

Before having this cup, I just finished a cup of Hawaiian coffee that was good but wasn't Kona.  This cup was too mild and smooth for my tastes.  I grind all of my coffee beans at home.  I like to have one cup of caffeinated coffee first and then follow this with one cup of decaffeinated coffee every morining.  The caffeinated coffees that I like include Kirkland's Guatemala and Ruwanda and Starbucks French Roast.  I like strong, bold flavorful coffee.  I also like Trader Joe's Seattle Blend and another very dark French roast that they sell.  I like Kirkland's decaff a little better than the decaff that Trader Joe's sells.  I have tried Trader Joe's Italian Roast decaff and liked it.  In general, I feel that decaffineated coffees are somewhat one dimensional in taste.  They have a good flavor, but it just isn't bold enough to suite me.  But, for a person who wants to limit their caffeine intake, both Kirkland's and Trader Joe's brands are pretty good and I recommend them.<br /><br />After grinding my own Starbucks French Roast for about two years now, I cannot drink Folgers or Maxwell House by themselves anymore.  I used to love their darker coffees but now find that they just don't have enough flavor to suit me anymore.  I use two rounded tablespoons of freshly ground coffee and filtered tap water to make my coffee.  On weekends, I use a french press to get a little more flavor out of that first cup of coffee.  Obviously, I'm not an expert on coffees but I know what I like and Kirkland's decaff is pretty good.  Of the caffeinated, I got tired of Starbucks French Roast after a while.  I like the the Guatemala a lot.  I want to try the Mayorca brand soon.",positive,1,335

I bought two packs because my husband and I are trying a low-fat, low-carb diet and I had been craving noodles.  Before I prepared them, I found a very helpful review here on amazon that gave some great tips on preparation:<br />1. Drain and rinse in a colander or sieve for a minute to remove most of the fishy smell. It is there, but you can rinse it off if you rinse it well.<br />2.  These are very long!  Much longer than your normal fettuccine noodle.  You might want to take kitchen shears and cut the noodles into thirds.  I usually leave them in the colander and snip around the pile of noodles.  It's not precise but it's easy.<br />3. Dry fry it in a frying pan for about 10 minutes on Medium.  You will notice the noodles become more opaque.  When you aren't seeing much wetness (not really standing water) in the pan when you move the noodles around, they are probably ready.<br />4. It may not be necessary but I remove them from the pan, prepare the rest of the dish, and then add them at the end.  I saute them in the pan with the other ingredients for about 5 minutes.<br /><br />Possible Preparation?  Try some soy, ginger, garlic, and chili paste.  Then add some tomato spinach, and mushrooms for a nice stir fry.  Or, shred some roast, saute it with some carrot and onion, spices and maybe a little bit of red wine for something like beef and noodles.<br /><br />The verdict?  These remind me of ramen noodles but with a little more bite to them.  They aren't a perfect substitute, but they work for me. They satisfy that craving for a noodle such that I am not feeling deprived. If you're on a diet that does not allow noodles, or if you are just trying to cut carbs, I think you have to set the right expectations.  They aren't meant to be an exact substitute.  You have to eat them with the knowledge that you are looking for an acceptable substitute.",positive,1,356

What I've noticed with this tea is how it makes the world shimmer. It is as if you are more aware of beauty when you have had a cup of this tea. I've read negative and positive things about yerba mate. So I think it is best to drink this tea occasionally and not to drink it instead of your normal tea or coffee. It is good if you want to focus on reading a good book but this tea can also make you a bit jittery from the caffeine. I also noticed that this was a good appetite suppressant. When I drank this a few hours before dinner I ate way less than normal. I was only eating a salad but made it much smaller than a dinner salad and even skipped adding the chicken. This tea also contains theobromine which is found in chocolate.

I use the little-squeeze-then-taste method, adding more little squeezes and sips until I have the perfect taste. I sure would prefer a less trial-and-error approach, but this method works for any quantity of water where the pre-measured powder packets don't.<br /><br />Once you perfect the amount of MiO to add to your water, it does taste great. I actually like having the water colored so I know which water bottle is flavored and which isn't.<br /><br />The label recommends use within one month of opening, which may be a few too many servings (24) of one flavor for an individual, but great for sharing with family or others.

Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.

The flavor is delicate, lightly smokey and not too salty.  Though oilier than sardines packed in other sauces, rest assured that these contain pure olive oil and the natural fats of the fishes, which make them a good source of heart-healthy omega-3.

The ingredients are simple:  Sardines, olive oil, and salt.<br /><br />How to eat them?<br /><br />Well, they are excellent right out of the can!

They are very good on toasted Fisherman's Warf type sourdough bread, lightly spread with mayo, sweet pickle relish, and a dash or two of Tobasco.

Imagine my pleased surprise when I mentioned this in a review and they responded to let me know they were releasing new flavors soon and encouraging me to keep trying new ones and keep reviewing! I know they read all reviews posted and I've received wonderfully kind responses to my reviews and emails to them. Their customer service is stellar and it makes it so that I want to recommend their teas to everyone I meet (and I do!). And while yes, I have gotten a ton of matcha through this promotion, I've also gained an adoration of matcha that will keep me coming to them long after I really do stop reviewing their product.

Brewed up, it still smelled like caramel, but with a hint of chocolate. And that's exactly what it tastes like, caramel mixed together with tasty, tasty chocolate. I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but this is very, very good. Very sweet too, but not overwhelmingly so. But then again, I like my teas sweet. But when I see pictures of English Toffee, this is what I think it would taste like, so yay! I love that it even tastes like that crunchy caramel....mmm.

Yup, that's right--there's no shortening (or oil).<br /><br />That was the whole point of the original Bisquick--a baking mix that ALREADY HAD THE SHORTENING MIXED IN.  That avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits  That is why people buy baking mixes--for that specific convenience.<br /><br />Betty Crocker has decided to leave out the shortening (or oil) altogether, even though shortening (or oil) is always naturally gluten-free. So they can't pretend it's a safety-for-celiacs factor.  It's a cost-savings to them, pure and simple.<br /><br />Here's the breakdown of what you're paying $5 a pound for:<br />rice flour (99 cents a pound at my local Asian store),<br />sugar ($2.88 for a 5 pound bag at Walmart) ,<br />potato starch (also 99 cents a pound at the Asian store),<br />baking powder ($3.19 a pound at Emergency Essentials),<br />salt ($2 for 26 ounces of Morton's),<br />xanthan gum ($10.45 for 4 ounce on Amazon).<br /><br />Yes, xanthan gum is expensive--but very, very little is needed; a 16-ounce box of gluten-free Bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum--maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum.<br /><br />Betty Crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their ""mix"" at home, while eliminating the major convenience factor (and cost to themselves, but not to you) of their regular baking mix.<br /><br />I don't mind their making a fair profit, especially if the product really WERE the equivalent of regular Bisquick.  But they're gouging us, and being misleading about the product.<br /><br />MAKE YOUR OWN, EASILY, AND FOR LESS THAN 20% OF WHAT THEY CHARGE!<br /><br />Since there's no oil in gluten-free Bisquick, you can easily stir up an equivalent, make 5 pounds (or more!) at a time, with very little effort, and it will keep for several months.<br /><br />Or, if you want a REAL Bisquick substitutes, betterbatter.org has a recipe on the site for a cup-for-cup substitute for Bisquick that DOES use shortening and non-fat dry milk powder.  Or you can use buttermilk powder, or even Vance's dairy-free powder.  It makes 10 cups at a time, stores well, and you don't have to use their gluten-free flour--you can use any gluten-free flour replacement you want (like rice flour and potato starch from your local Asian store, mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum, about 1/2 teaspoon for every two cups).<br /><br />To find the recipe, do a google search of ""betterbatter Bisquick Substitute Master Mix.""<br /><br />Boo on Betty Crocker.",negative,-1,527

Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.

There are 3 in a serving size, packing 5 grams of fat and 140 calories.  For 5 grams of fat I either want something yummy enough to be worth it, or filling enough to make me believe I just consumed 5 grams of fat (some of which is saturated).  So this is not a snack to hold you over between meals, dieters.  I suppose the 8 grams of whole grains are attractive, but that just translates into 21 grams of carbs and only 2 grams of fiber.  So this is not really a healthy fiber treat either.  Now you might say that this isn't a health food, so I shouldn't be judging, but by calling them 'thins', Nabisco is looking to aim at the dieting market.<br /><br />I guess I was hoping for something more chewy than crunchy.

So little and chewy, in fact, that they get stuck in your teeth and have you uncomfortably nomming around like a dog with peanut butter on his tongue.  The fig and honey variety had a taste and consistency somewhat reminiscent of a graham cracker, but a little drier.<br /><br />So I'm not a fan of these, and I probably wouldn't buy them while roaming around the grocery store, but I'm giving them 3 stars on the strength of Newtons *other* fruit products, the Fig Newtons and the Newtons Fruit Crisps.  Both of those are chewy, delicious, and amazing.",neutral,0,298

Adding milk gives the tea an amazing body and unlike a reviewer said below, there is no notes of green olives nor of cough syrup - this tea is simply astounding.<br /><br />I've tried Stash's Mango/Passion fusion and their Chai tea but didn't care for those, then I stumbled upon this one and O-M-G is all I had to say.

The taste is also amazing, very fruity and very very endearing. However, on the downside, I would not recommend that you make this tea with water alone, although it is a very smooth tea, it lacks body - thus, like I said before, make it as follows:<br /><br />Steep in 4oz hot water with 2 teaspoons of cane sugar (or substitute your own)<br />Add 4oz warm milk<br /><br />The milk as I said gives it extra body that the tea lacks, however it is forgiveable.

I was diagnosed with abnormally high blood pressure for my age about a year ago. On top of this I also suffer from extreme anxiety, nervousness, sleep issues, muscle aches, etc. After many tests, blood pressure medication and Zoloft, nothing really seemed to work. About a month ago I was getting a colonic and my hydrotherapist said that I was more than likely magnesium deficient. 2 days later I saw my urologist who diagnosed me (after a 24 hour urine test) with exactly that, magnesium deficiency. I went down to the local health food store and the clerk recommended that I try ""Natural Calm""; As usual, I was skeptical (especially with the $20 price tag on an 8 oz. bottle). Needless to say, I was willing to give anything a shot.<br /><br />I must say...this is a MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!! I take it 2 times a day (1-1/2 tsp. in the morning and 1-1/2 tsp. in the evening). This stuff gives me energy when I need it, all the while calming me down and 100% eliminating my nervousness and anxiety. I'm waking up in a snap and falling asleep even quicker (I stopped taking sleep aids). I have a great night of sleep and notice my body is requiring less sleep to achieve the same results. As for the body and muscle aches...those, too, have disappeared. I don't have to swallow Alieve everyday anymore to alleviate these symptoms because ""Natural Calm"" does the job.<br /><br />I've been taking ""Natural Calm"" for about 2-1/2 weeks now and am truly grateful that I stumbled upon this product. People at work, as well as my girlfriend, son, and parents have all noticed a change in me. Best of all, the change I feel within myself is amazing. All the little problems my M.D. couldn't iron out were immediately dealt with upon my first dose of this stuff.<br /><br />As for negatives to ""Natural Calm""...I see none. Many people have complained about the taste, but to me the stuff tastes fine; almost similar to Sprite, but with a hint of a sour citrus kick.<br /><br />All in all 5+ stars. ""Natural Calm"" will be a part of my daily regime from this day forward. If you truly have a magnesium deficiency, look no further...this is the answer.",positive,1,394

I stopped at my local ""mom & pop"" pet food store and asked some questions. I knew little about the better brands as she's always been on grocery store brands. I was directed toward Orijen as it is one of the better brands out there, it's very high in protein, you can understand all of the ingredients and it's ""so healthy, a human could eat it"". Of course I bought it, and my dog loved it. Little did I know how damaging the food was to her, as quite honestly, she exhibited no symptoms. Back in January my dog had to be put in the ICU due to an accident. It was during that stay where the vet noticed how high her liver levels were. Her alkaline & phosphatase as well as her calcium levels in the kidneys were all very high as well. The vet put her on 3 different liver support medicines and we had to follow up every month with more blood work to reassess the situation. After the 3rd month, the vet was suspicious that cancer was present. When I hear that, I immediately did some research on the food. It was then that I noticed how high the protein content is and what that much protein could do to a body. I presented my research and concerns to the vet, who wasn't as convinced as I was. After the 4th blood draw, and still no changes, we made the mutual decision to wean her off of Orijen and on to Science Diet (although just about any other brand would have worked too). A month later after the switch, and my dog was presented with a clean bill of health. Her alkaline & phosphatase levels are still slightly elevated, but I'm told there is nothing to worry about now. We concluded it was the food that was damaging and slowly killing her, as she was deemed healthy at the start of feeding her the food, A few months prior to all of this, she went though a full work up in order to get her teeth cleaned.<br /><br />I write this not to slander Orijen, I only want to educate others on my own personal experience. While it happened to my dog, that doesn't mean it will effect all dogs the same. Just please keep in mind, my dog showed no symptoms while on the food that anything was wrong. If it weren't for her stay in the hospital, we never would have known how much damage this food was causing her. If your dog is presently on this food, maybe a precautionary blood draw at their next exam would be worth your while.",negative,-1,499

Do your research!,"This is a really good choice for a nutritionally sound, lower calorie food, and our cat (admittedly not picky) immediately devoured it. But the real message here is: you need to find out how many kcal/day your cat needs for weight loss, research the calories in your cat's food, and accurately measure your feeding. There do not appear to be industry standards for what's labeled as 'weight management', 'light' etc., and the differences are dramatic!<br /><br />Our very young and energetic cat starting piling on weight from when he was a kitten. Maybe he stuffs himself because he's a 'rescue'--I don't know whether he might have had some starvation in his early weeks that marked him for life! but we had to put him on adult food before his kitten year was up, on the advice of our veterinarian--and he went on to gain weight up to almost 20 lb. even when giving the recommended daily amount of food, measured, divided into 2 daily feedings.<br /><br />We decided to switch from a Purina Pro Plan regular adult formula to their 'weight management' formula--still, kitty was gaining. When I finally did the research of how many kcal/day he should be getting and how many kcal we were giving him (mind you--the recommended, measured amount), I was shocked. The packaging recommends 56-84 g./day of the food for weight loss, for a cat with a goal weight of 10-14 lbs. That's 214-321 calories, measured by their own nutrition information. But my research at [...] showed that the recommended amount should be 187 calories/day for weight loss, for a goal weight of 10-12 lb. That means the *minimum* amount recommended by the Purina label was 27 more calories/day than he should be getting--or 14% more! and the maximum 'recommended' amount was 72% more than he should be getting for weight loss.<br /><br />[...] has a publication with calorie counts/cup of a wide variety of cat food: [...]<br />The range of calories/up is staggering. Anyone with an overweight cat--do your cat a favor and research how many calories/day they *should* be getting, and how many calories the 'recommended' amount that you're feeding actually is.<br /><br />After finding out how much of the Pro Plan Weight Management per day to offer, I thought our problems were over--I started giving him a daily amount with the right calories for weight loss. And he did start losing, at a slow but safe rate: about .2 lb/week. But he was constantly, frantically hungry. I looked further, for a nutritionally sound food that could give him more volume and fill him up while still not exceeding the calories he would need for weight loss. With the help of [...] for nutritional ratings, and the calorie chart on [...], I selected Science Diet Light--with approximately 75% of the calories per cup compared to the Purina Pro Plan. I can now give him 9g/day more, and I think the higher fiber content of this food will help him feel more full. While it does cost more than his previous food, the difference is not going to break the bank--I estimate it will cost me $4 more per month.",positive,1,526

Once that happened my own instincts and natural cravings made more sense...I was looking at the ingredients to this candy bar at the time because I'd had sucn intense cravings for the Chunky and back then they actually listed the K+ levels....per full size bar at over 300 mg. That certainly explained it. Since I've never denied my cravings for it though my K levels are back to normal. Today they no longer list K levels.....but why not Chunky? You should reconsider....nothing wrong with promotion of some good stuff along with this product. K+ is good for people after excercise and hard work.

And a good chocolate chip cookie can hit the spot sometimes, even for those of us who aren't THAT fond of chocolate.<br /><br />So the Chips Ahoy cookies here are a variation I haven't tried in their product line before.<br /><br />The cookie dough itself is about normal for them, not quite great but not bad, either.

There's a LOT of chocolate in there compared to any other chocolate chip cookie.  For me, it was overwhelming, way too much chocolate.  My 7 year old said the same, took a bite, made a face, and threw the rest of it away.<br /><br />But these aren't being marketed to people who don't like chocolate, so our problem shouldn't be an issue with anyone that purchases these.<br /><br />Chocolate is pretty normal tasting mass produced cookie type of chocolate, with a pretty smooth consistency to it.  Again, nothing to rejoice about, but if you like a lot of chocolate in your chocolate chip cookiess, it will definitely float your boat.<br /><br />They're about the size of a silver dollar, give or take, so they're not very large, but given how sweet they are, I think anything larger would be overkill.<br /><br />If you like store bought prepackaged cookies, these should be just fine, if not a little better tasting than most of the other options.",positive,1,341

In the last two weeks we have had issues where the device wouldn't steam intermittently.  Everything was done exactly the same way.  No user error.  Then finally last week it seems the bearings (I think they have bearing) in the center colum broke.  The underside of the Baby brezza is dark - presumably from the grease in the bearings.  The device would steam, but the blade would not spin.<br />Then today, it stopped steaming as well.  About to send the product back.  Had nothing but problems with this since we got it.  $100 just wasted.  Wouldn't recommend it.  Extrememly frustrating when at the last minute you have to figure out some other way to feed your kid.  Products like this need to work, and work well.  They are after all for children and will be used everyday!  Not sure what kind of quality control this company has.<br /><br />(update after a couple of weeks of use)<br />The product does work well.  Yes there are some lumps but if you manually hit the blend button for a bit longer you can get a very smooth puree for your child.<br />The one other issue I have found is that the blade is a bit difficult to take off.  I have to pull it quite hard 40% of the time - hard enought that I though I was going to break the plastic.  My wife felt the same way.  So my rating of 3 stars don't change, however it is stable and good product and we do use it daily.<br /><br />Overall the product works.  However I did have one major problem.  The first time I tried to use the product, it would steam, and the motor would turn on but the blade wouldn't spin.  I called up Baby Brezza and it turns out they had a manufacturing issue where the belt had slipped off the cog for the blade.  They knew about the issue and immediately told me to remove the 5 screws from the bottom, remove the cover and slip the belt onto the cog.  All in all, it was easy to do and took all but 5 minutes.  However, the fact that you get a product that would not work right out the box was a huge dissapointment and my wife was really frustrated.<br />On the plus side, the lady at Baby Brezza did know the issue and was able to get me going right away.  First time I have had success with customer service with any company.",negative,-1,431

What a delicious way to g35 14grams of fiber!<br /><br />Instead of sugar, Chocoperfection uses erythritol which has 95% fewer calories than sugar, 93% fewer than maltitol, and no effect on insulin levels, and oligofructose, a sweet tasting dietary fiber made primarily from chicory (not the same as fructose).<br /><br />These silky-smooth, delicious chocolate bars actually help you lose weight because the high fiber content and the high fiber content also acts as an appetite suppressant.<br /><br />And unlike maltitol-sweetened chocolate, ChocoPerfection bars will never upset your stomach, give you gas, make you bloat, or stall your weight loss.  Chocolate Perfect!<br /><br />On top of all that, Chocoperfection is diabetic-safe and tooth-freindly, too.  What more could you ask of a chocolate bar?<br /><br />What is erythritol?<br /><br />Like xylitol, erythritol is a polyol or sometimes called a sugar-alcohol (although none of them contain sugar or alcohol,) and has some of the cavity-fighting similarities.<br /><br />Xylitol is as sweet as sugar and has about 2/3 the calories.<br /><br />Erythritol, on the other hand, is about 70% as sweet as sugar and and almost zero calories.  Plus it is better tolerated by most people<br /><br />with less gastronomical or laxative reactions.  By the way, XylitolNow sells erythritol in bulk on the main product page.<br /><br />Being only 70% as sweet as sugar, erythritol sometimes needs a little help in the sweetness department. In the case of these bars, that's where oligofrutose comes in.<br /><br />What is oligofructose?<br /><br />Oligofructose<br />From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br /><br />Oligofructose, sometimes called Fructooligosaccharide or just  (FOS), is a subgroup of inulin, specifically those fructose polymers with a degree of polymerization (DP) &lt;= 10. Unlike most carbohydrates, it is not digested in the human small intestine and thus has a lower calorific value, whilst contributing to dietary fiber. Oligofructose is on the more soluble side, due to its lower chain length, than the general class of inulins and is therefore commonly used as an additive to yoghurt and other dairy products. It is used specially in combination with high-intensity artificial sweeteners, whose sweetness profile and aftertaste it improves. Oligofructose is also a prebiotic stimulating the growth of bifidobacteria in particular.<br /><br />Food Sources<br />FOS is extracted from fruits and vegetables like bananas, onions, chicory root, garlic, asparagus, barley, wheat, and tomatoes. The Jerusalem Artichoke has been found to have one of the highest concentrations of FOS. (In the case of Chocoperfection, the oligofructose is extracted from chicory root.)<br /><br />Health Benefits<br />FOS has been a popular dietary supplement in Japan for many years and is now becoming increasingly popular in Western cultures for its prebiotic effects. FOS serves as ""fast food"" for the probiotic beneficial or ""friendly"" bacteria that naturally populate the gut, increasing their ability to benefit overall Gastrointestinal Tract (GI Tract) health, especially proper digestion. It has also been touted as a supplement for preventing yeast infections.<br /><br />And this from Steggall Nutrition:<br /><br />Oligofructose is a tremendous substrate for bifidus bacteria, stimulating its activity by several hundred percent. This is called prebiotic activity, referring to stimulation of health promoting bacteria in the intestinal tract. Short chain fatty acids are produced, lowering pH levels and providing an energy source for the growth and maintenance of large intestine cells. This process leads to differentiation of cancer cells, a vital step that is required before cancer cells can be killed.<br /><br />The ideal environment for healthy bacteria is quite different to the environment preferred by pathogens and gram negative putrefactive bacteria. Consequently the undesirable bacteria diminish in number as the healthy bacteria proliferate in the presence of oligofructose.",positive,1,634

I planted my gardens (one gourmet herbs, one holiday herbs) three months ago and I have trouble keeping up with the amount of growth.  I use a lot of parsley and thyme so I'm delighted there is so much, but the excess of some of the others is going to the freezer. . . more chervil than I've ever seen.  The plants are healthy and clean with no bugs like outside gardens.  What a blessing.<br /><br />Yes, the lights are the very white daylight bulbs, but in my den, it adds nice lighting where I wouldn't otherwise have any and I rarely use the overhead light anymore so the electricity is a wash for me.  The pump in one garden made noise at first, but I read the FAQs on the website, which said it was likely that nutrients had gotten into the pump.  I jiggled the pump a bit and the problem went away.  Since then I put the nutrients at the front of the water well and have had no further problems.  Some people complain about the dripping sound but if you keep the water level up you don't hear it.<br /><br />I tried for years to grow fresh herbs indoors during the winter and was never really successful until now.  The units are very easy to care for and you can't beat the prolific harvest.  Now, if only they'd let me choose the individual herbs to grow instead of offering just the combination sets.  I may have to try planting my own seeds as they have kits that allow you to do that.  I'm looking forward to free salads all summer when it comes time to replant. Great product.",positive,1,287

These are very similar to Willy Wonka Runts, but somewhat smaller and more tart.  The only issue with it is that it seems that the oranges make up an outsize percentage of the mix.  I suppose that it is possible that buying it from the machine somehow filtered out the larger orange pieces.  Also, the orange pieces are more like jawbreakers and I will have to warn guests about trying to bite down on them right away.  The other pieces are not quite as hard.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the 2.5 lbs. mix and it should last me for several months.

So, I was likewise hesitant with 5-hour Energy.<br /><br />After hearing all of the radio ads, though, and constantly seeing these little red bottles on the gas station counters, I had to give it a shot. I kind of coughed it down the first time as the flavor wasn't real great to me, but I figured it was only 2 ounces and I could get it down. I'm sure glad I did, because I was amazed at what it did for me. Using vitamins and minerals (and the same caffeine dose as in a cup of coffee), I was given energy that lasted and did not cause me to crash!<br /><br />I try to keep some of this stuff on hand (berry is my favorite by the way) and I usually take this when I am feeling like I really need a nap but the nap isn't an option. While it doesn't instantaneously feel like leaping off roofs, if I can motivate myself to start some project, within a half an hour I notice I am not tired anymore!

For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash.

How would ""I"" rate the item?  Do ""I"" like it?  Uh, sure, I feel really emotional about this item and I absolutely love it, can't you just picture me sitting here chewing on one of these treat biscuits?<br /><br />I suppose I shouldn't joke too much here since there's been stories of some people eating dog food for years, but really, I'm the human in the animal+human equation here and my opinion really isn't the one that matters for this product.  What matters is what the doggie thinks, or how she seems to react to being given one of these treats.  It's here that things remain tough though as the family dog behaves like many dogs do -- if it's at all edible, and heck, for a lot of things that aren't (like her stuffed toys that all die quick deaths), she'll have it gone so quickly you question whether she ever even tasted whatever it was you gave her.<br /><br />With that said, these dry biscuits do tend to slow her down a little, at least compared to some of the other treats we might give her.  (For example: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OUOYH6"">Cardinal Laboratories Pet Botanics Training Rewards Treats, Beef 20 Ounces</a>).  Being dry, she's got to slow down a bit and crunch up these treats.  In our case, with a smaller dog (Pomeranian), she really has to crunch things up, even if we break these biscuits apart (they come as breakable bars with two smaller portions in each bar).  A larger dog wouldn't have that much work to do, or at least I doubt they would.

330358,B005ATVY88,AC5UIM0EA1BNZ,PalFam,4.0,4.0,4.0,1322611200.0,Good results but contains soy,"I received Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food to try as a BzzAgent.  I'm feeding this to my terrier as he tends to show the results to changes in his diet quicker than my Corgi or Belgian Sheepdog.  I've been a dog mom for more than 20 years, including participating in dog sports such as sled dog running, agility and dog shows.  Proper nutrition is vital to dogs' health and ability to participate in things they love to do.  While I currently don't do these activities with my dogs, I still am very picky about what they eat.<br /><br />When I received my BzzKit, a 4lb bag of Hill's Science Diet, Ideal Balance Dog Food, I checked the ingredients.  The first listed is chicken (good!) followed by brown rice and whole grain wheat (not as good as a meat ingredient, but better than it being corn).  Next is cracked pearl barley, soybean meal and chicken meal.  I have to admit I paused at the soybean meal.  In my experience, soy has not been a positive addition to dog food.  I find that foods that contain it result in looser stools of greater volume, and the dog's overall condition is not as high as one fed a food without soy.  It's an inexpensive ingredient that is associated with ""filler"" in the dog community.  I was curious to see how my terrier would handle and fare on this food. 3 stars for only one meat ingredient in the first 5 ingredients, and for the inclusion of soy.<br /><br />Rex, my terrier, became immediately interested when I opened the bag.  He was VERY anxious to see what was in there, so the smell must have been very enticing.  He's not a picky eater, so I anticipated he'd like the Ideal Balance, but didn't anticipate how eager he was to get it!  I slowly, over the course of days, switched him to Ideal Balance from his previous food (to reduce stomach upset from a diet change), and found he ate the Ideal Balance nuggets first before cleaning his bowl.  It may be because it was new and novel, but it may have been because he liked it better.  He's a dog...he couldn't tell me.  He seems to like it so much that I can even use Ideal Balance as a training treat.  5 Stars for taste.<br /><br />Rex has been eating Ideal Balance for a couple of weeks now.  It's not long enough for a complete picture of its impact on his condition, but long enough to get an idea of how it's going for him.<br /><br />His coat is very nice.  It was nice before, and I haven't seen any change in the coat condition.  The Ideal Balance diet is at least maintaining his coat in good condition.  We need more time to see the food's long term impact in Rex's coat.  4 stars for coat maintenance.<br /><br />Rex has a tendency to gain weight.  We really have to watch how much he eats.  And Ideal Balance helps him pack it on!  This means I can feed him less, which means I'm buying less food in the long run.  But I really have to watch his weight.  And it means that he is getting a lot out of the food.  The crude protein is 21.5% and crude fat is 12.5%.  The protein is not high, but the fat content is maybe a little higher than I'd seek for him.  I might choose a weight control version of Ideal Balance if this becomes his regular diet (and if one exists).  5 stars for body weight maintenance.<br /><br />Now the down and dirty part of the review...stools.  A dog's stool can tell you a lot about how he is tolerating his diet.  Rex's stools on Ideal Balance are firm, maybe a little larger than they were on his previous food, and do not smell any more objectionable than normal.  This tells me he is digesting the food normally, as well as close to optimally.  They could be a little smaller, but not so much that if I wasn't looking for a change that I'd have necessarily noticed it.  5 stars for stool quality.<br /><br />Overall, I give Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food 4 stars.  If there were a 2nd meat source and/or soy wasn't present, I could in good faith give it 5 stars, based on Rex's condition on the diet.  If you do try it, be sure to monitor your dog's weight, and adjust how much you feed accordingly.",positive,1,758

She seldom enjoyed that chewing exercise.  The C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews are the perfect chewable treat for her now and the byproduct is brief moments of breath freshening.  It does not take the place of eating kibble and my brushing her teeth, but she really enjoys these chews and they are just the right size for a small dog of 13 pounds.  In the past, I purchased the larger size and cut them with heavy duty scissors, but these petite chews are fine as is.  Unlike rawhide chews, these are consumed rather quickly and don't require the strongest of teeth, so they are much better for older dogs who still like to chew.  I think they are a little pricy, so I look for special values which occasionally occur on Amazon, always much better than the price at the vet.",positive,1,162

I like the fact that this product wheat free, soy free, corn free, gluten free peanut free and to top everything off it's certified kosher. In my opinion the ginger snapz tasted good ... very 'snappy' - for lack of a better word. When you are allergic to the things I am allergic to you read the labels/ingredients of foods/snacks and you notice that pretty much everything contains SOMETHING that you are allergic to. So I am grateful for this product being made. I've read several reviews and I've noticed that most of the people who gave the ginger snapz a low rating kept saying they had a sandy taste. FYI: Look at the ingredients, it contains rice flour. Rice flour has a sandy/grainy type of feeling when eaten/felt. With that being said, I let my mom and my brother taste the ginger snapz. (Both of them aren't allergic to anything whatsoever). They said that it tasted good but it left a grainy/sandy after taste in their mouths. Once again, this product does contain rice flour. With that being said, remember people - this product has no wheat, soy, corn, or peanuts. I give credit where credit is due, they stripped some of the most common ingredients that people are allergic to and still ended up with an excellent tasting snack. 4 out of 5 because after I ate about 6 snapz and got over the actual feeling of me actually eating something that I wasn't allergic to *smiles* .. I did taste the sandy/grainy-ness that people were talking about. No complains though. I can make ice cream sandwiches now, no complains at all.",positive,1,283

It does make a decent vinaigrette as I mixed it with olive oil and had a salad for breakfast this morning.  You don't need a lot.<br /><br />It's simply not up to par with better balsamics that work well with eveything. I'm partial to thicker, sweeter balsamics, so take that as you will.

Filled with condroitin and glucosamine for the mature dog with hip problems (the blue heeler), I thought I'd give them a try.  Though I don't see any distinct improvement in our 12 year-old Sydney's hips, I don't see anything detrimental either.  They come to the cupboard after coming in from outside or a bath just as before and gobble them down like a kid with candy.  The China factor makes me a little uneasy, especially at that price, but I see no ill effects thus far.  I asked my vet today what she thought, and she said that they're probably fine as long as they're not recalled, but the laws in China are less strict about what they put in their products.

I have to add that my boyfriend and I got into a huge fight earlier that day about him not wanting me to wear these really cute shorts that I found on sale at TJ Max that were like short but not THAT short, and I had this really cute top that I wanted to wear with them but he was like ""you look super slutty in those shorts"" and I was all like ""Whatever Ramondo, you wear like those cholo shirts out every day and I don't say anything about that!""  Anyways, point being I was ready to try something new!  So the water arrived and all my girlfriends and I each took a bottle.  My first reaction was...""I don't think i can put something THIS black in my mouth""  But I had spent 55$ a case on this so I just sucked it down (that will show Ramondo LOLOLOLZZZZ....)<br /><br />It sorta tasted like I expected...like dirt water...but like not bad dirt water..like dirt water you drank when you went with your uncle to the river when you were six to go swimming with him and then you would jump in and accidentally drink a little river water.<br /><br />So overall i was pretty please with it but I was really upset about the TJ Max shorts and Ramondo so 2.5 stars<br /><br />XOXOXOXOXOXO-",negative,-1,287

The taste is also amazing, very fruity and very very endearing.

To me it mostly tastes like a mild lemony tea. It tastes pretty good with a few tablespoons of powdered milk (so it doesn't dilute the taste like milk would) and a packet of stevia. What I've noticed with this tea is how it makes the world shimmer. It is as if you are more aware of beauty when you have had a cup of this tea. I've read negative and positive things about yerba mate. So I think it is best to drink this tea occasionally and not to drink it instead of your normal tea or coffee. It is good if you want to focus on reading a good book but this tea can also make you a bit jittery from the caffeine. I also noticed that this was a good appetite suppressant. When I drank this a few hours before dinner I ate way less than normal. I was only eating a salad but made it much smaller than a dinner salad and even skipped adding the chicken. This tea also contains theobromine which is found in chocolate.

Some are clearly NOT good for you, some are, and some are just OK. You aren't going to be on a 3-hour sugar buzz, but neither are you really doing yourself that huge of a favor. Perhaps you are one of those who thought Raisin Bran was good for you... until you found out it has more sugar than Fruit Loops!<br /><br />Enter Quaker Oatmeal Squares, in this case infused with ""a hint"" of cinnamon. My first two thoughts are 1) must be good for you if it's from Quaker Oats! and 2) mmm... cinnamon!<br /><br />Bottom line: IF you sweeten it a bit, this cereal is good and crunchy at first. It does NOT have an overwhelming cinnamon flavor, and in some ways is a bit bland. But the flavor is acceptable. The crunch will wear off quickly, though, if you let it soak for more than a couple of minutes.<br /><br />The pitch is that ""each square has cinnamon baked into it"". Well, honestly, does it matter if it's baked in or sprinkled on? I think it could use a bit more flavor, but that's mostly just my opinion. Others may find it just right. The cereal consists of 46 grams of whole grains per serving, so that part is good. If you are going to consume cereal, you should consume those made with whole grains. It also packs a decent amount of soluble fiber (5g) and protein (6g - high for a dry cereal). There are 210 calories in a 1 cup serving of Quaker Oatmeal Squares Cereal (Cinnamon). The caloric breakdown is: 10% fat, 79% carbs, 11% protein. The cereal has 9g of sugar per serving.<br /><br />So if you're a cereal eater and looking for something healthier than Cap'n Crunch, this is probably a ""better"" selection. That said, I caution anyone against starting their day with a ton of carbohydrates, especially those derived from sugary sources. And as with anything, be aware of what a ""serving"" is and practice moderation. If not measured out, many folks would potentially consume 2-3 servings (in this case cups) in a single bowl, which would equate to a quick 400-600 calories just for breakfast!",neutral,0,378

I tried Ryvita (can't remember what flavor, but it is the sodium free one), and it tastes like cardboard. I couldn't find Finn Crisp at any of my local stores.

Makes me wonder why the magazine people say this crispbread can go topless, and why pretty much everyone who wrote a review think this stuff tastes good.

The way I use them is to nuke them in the microwave for a couple minutes and it makes a nice spicy pepperoni chip for a low carb diet. Kind of reminds me of thin slices of spicy bacon. Anyway I have done this with lots of different kinds of pepperoni. This pepperoni astonishes me at the quantity of fat that is thrown off during cooking. The grease soaks through several layers of paper towel. People talked about eating them raw and if you did, that would be a lot of fat! No other pepperoni I have tried has generated this quantity of fat during cooking.<br /><br />Now once they have crisped up and you have gotten rid of most of the fat, they are crispy and quite nice. The slices are very thin, so if you go too long they will burn in a flash. I am going to try the thick sliced to see how they work.<br /><br />**UPDATE** tried the thick sliced and they are perfect for my application of pepperoni chips! Way better than the thin sliced. Still amazed by how much orange grease comes off these things during microwaving, but when they are done cooking they are a great consistency and have a nice amount of kick to them. Kind of like spicy bacon. I imagine the thick would be very good on pizza if you don't mind some oil added to your pie.",positive,1,247

She was on nausea medications, antibiotics for her ears, and several different ear washes. Nothing completely cured any of her issues. After doing a lot of research, i came across Wellness white fish and sweet potato and couldn't be happier. Over a 10 day period, i slowly changed over her food from the Iams i had been feeding her. It has now been about 3 months and she is a completely different dog. Since fully switching over to this food, she hasn't thrown up once and she is no longer scratching at her ears. She has more energy and always wants to play. I no longer have to coax her into eating by mixing in wet food with the Iams. She wags her tail when she sees me filling her bowl now and eats right away. She even licks the bowl when she is done and looks at me for more.

Apple matcha pie, anyone? Or apple fritters with an apple matcha icing...yes, please! I make homemade donuts occasionally...can you imagine a big apple cake donut covered in cinnamon sugar? I may have to make donuts in the near future. I hope this matcha lives up to all of the plans I have for it. And I hope it gives me the energy to follow through on those plans! Because now that I've mentioned it, if I don't make donuts in the near future, my wife will be devastated.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is just not for me. The smell of the dry matcha has the smell of the more bitter matchas I've had from Red Leaf Tea, and that smell carried through into the taste of the brewed tea. It tastes something like apple candy when you power through the bitterness, which is nice, but far from the apple juice I was craving. I'm not an apple candy type of girl, unless it's a sour apple. It might still be good as a latte, but I won't be cooking with it, sadly. Still it isn't terrible, and the bitterness seems to fade over time. Maybe it will still hold up to donuts, as the amount of sugar in them will balance out the bitterness. I don't really think this is one I need to get more of, and if any of my local friends want a taste, I'm happy to share. I'll experiment with what I have left, maybe I can find a way to fall in love with this tea. But personally I'm going to stick with the Green Apple matcha, also from Red Leaf Teas.",neutral,0,406

She has more energy and always wants to play. I no longer have to coax her into eating by mixing in wet food with the Iams.

So I was determined not to overcook these brown rice noodles. I tried making two dishes. The first was a miso soup with brown rice noodles, which was really just broth with miso and green onions and the noodles added when it was hot. The noodles softened and puffed up, but I think I should of softened them in water and maybe rinsed them first. The broth ended up being a little starchy from the noodles, but it was pretty good.<br /><br />The noodles by themselves don't really have any flavor, they just take on the flavor of whatever dish they are in. So the rice noodles in miso probably wasn't the best idea because the mild miso flavor didn't really give the noodles much flavor. I also tried stir frying the noodles which was much better. I just soaked the noodles in hot water, for about a minute, and then drained them. They came out clear and kind of crunchy. Then I stir fried them with garlic, onion, salt, and coconut oil. I also added some vinegar and nama shoyu for flavor. These noodles came out crunchy and spicy and actually were pretty good.<br /><br />The nice thing about these noodles is they only need about a minute in warm water and then they can be fried or added to soups or other dishes, so they are fairly versatile. They are also gluten free and the brown rice noodles seem more firm than the white rice noodles. As another reviewer posted it does look like these noodles are made in Singapore.",positive,1,278

I make lattes 2 times a day and always use Starbucks coffee beans fresh and kept in the freezer until use. From the day it arrived, this machine made horrible coffee... but since I ordered it from Amazon and spent over 800 after shipping on it I decided to give it a while to see if I could get it to work better. I adjusted the grind, and the dose and tried over and over. What I found is that the espresso was very inconsistent, the red error light would go off multiple times during use. Sometimes it would make a somewhat decent shot of espresso and then I would adjust nothing and the next time it would shoot out watery crap, or it would drip out half a shot and stop. It has been so infuriating. Finally after a month I called customer service to complain they told me I should be priming the pump with each use of the machine... which I tried, for about 2 cups I thought it was fixed then I was back to square one. Now after another month I am at my wits end. I wake up every morning hope it's going to make a decent cup, and end up drinking a watery cup of awful latte... grumpy until I decide to purchase a latte somewhere later in the day. I'm done hoping, like my husband says you can piss in one hand and wish in the other and see which one fills up first.. Today I am calling to return this awful piece of junk... and hopefully I will at least get my money back. Never will I purchase another product from this company, what a disappointment.

Totally, I have had ~7 different brands of turkey jerky and ~8 of the beef variety .  Among turkey, Oberto is my favorite by far.<br /><br />Given that jerky is made by a dehydration process, dryness is inherent to jerky as a food.  Also, turkey is a dryer meat than beef (the most common jerky) and I've found turkey jerky to be, on average, dryer than beef jerky.  I prefer my jerky relatively moist.<br /><br />Oberto Turkey Jerky is by far the most moist jerky I've had (aside from the Oberto Pork brand). The package usually has very large strips that hold their water content for greater lengths of time.  The other brands I've tried are broken into small pieces and are very chewy & dry in comparison.  Another key aspect is the flavoring.  This product is well-flavored whereas other products often taste like proteinated cardboard.  For a teriyaki flavor, Oberto doesn't overdo on salt either and the entire product is natural and less processed.<br /><br />Overview:<br />Pros- Moist, Tastey, Natural & Minimally Processed<br />Cons- Oberto Turkey only comes in Teriyaki<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you want Turkey Jerky and don't mind teriyaki, this is probably the best, easily obtainable product out there.",positive,1,234

During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional ""Gyokuro"" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping.",positive,1,459

Went through Puppy Chow, generic puppy chow, and Iams and then I started reading up on dog foods- and boy, did I learn a lot! No more grocery store food unless it is an ""emergency"" where getting online is not possible or we run out before the shipment arrives. That stuff is pure crap.<br /><br />We then went through a bag of Orijen, which I think is an excellent food, but not for her. She would eat it with toppings only and rarely ate all of it. Stools were often loose- not to mention the gas.<br /><br />A tiny dog can only eat about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of food per day so he/she needs to eat it all and it needs to be packed with nutrition. Back to the drawing board since the Orijen didn't work!<br /><br />Next we tried the Wellness Super5Mix Adult Small Breed. She eats every bite and licks the dish and sometimes wants an evening snack of the plain Wellness kibble. She eats it without any topping but I do usually mix in a TBS of wet food (or cottage cheese) which Wellness recommends in order to give the dog a bit of extra fluid. We live in the desert, so that's important. Anyway, she REALLY loves that! She has cleaned her plate twice daily ever since I started her on this wonderful food. The stools are formed and no gas.<br /><br />It seems to be the perfect food for her- and maybe for other dogs too which is why I am writing this. It is such a relief to see her eating a good nutritious dog food and enjoying it.<br /><br />I would definitely give it a try if your dog has ""pickyness""/appetite/digestion issues, or if you just want to provide 4 star nutrition. It costs more than the grocery store stuff, but a small dog doesn't eat much so I make it fit into my budget. I try to include it in with the occasional larger Amazon order and get  free shipping. It may be available in pet stores as well, but I have to go 15-20 miles out of town to find a pet store, so ordering online is easier.<br /><br />I highly recommend trying this food.",positive,1,398

(Thank you Weederspoon for illuminating the Bible.)<br /><br />I bought it for my health.  I did not know, that it would make my taste buds sing ""hallelujah!"". I felt physically better in less that 24 hours. It is the best honey product on this Earth. The aroma is intoxicating. I put the honey in my tea, but I also ate a spoonful for an instant health kick. (Be fore-warned; you will want to eat the entire jar.)<br /><br />It can be used on skin eruptions, pimples, ulcers etc.  It can possibly save diabetics an amputation if their wounds are treated with this honey instead of endless rounds of antibiotics that are not working.) I would use it sooner than later.  (There is a tendency to only try alternatives as a last resort.)<br /><br />If you are just a gourmet and not a health-nut: this is the honey for you. I never want to see a different honey product again.  Only Weederspoon Raw Organic Manuka Honey Active 16+ will do it for me.",positive,1,238

Now mind you, I am a Starbucks drinker. I LOVE my coffee and I have for years. I told my doctor and myself that this was not possible. However, I re-thought and considering my health issues, I decided to take the plunge, so to speak. . . into the No-coffee, no caffeine pool. But what to substitute on those cold mornings??? I have enjoyed Stash Chai tea for a few years but it was always a treat for winter days when I was already over-coffeed. I tried many teas to see if anything satisfied to replace for my morning joe. Nothing, truly, Nothing satisfied my taste buds, my comfort buttons...my need for a stimulating aroma. Until. . . I went back to my STASH Chai. Decaf as it is, it satisfies all my taste and aroma needs and we are now 7 months out and I declare myself fully De-coffee'd. I no longer need that cup of jolt any longer and I am fully satisfied by my STASH decaf chai. I am amazed and delighted! I want to stock up on my tea, lest they stop making it! Heaven forbid!

It was such a surprize when I saw this tea at the top of the search results list. I bought this tea as part of a Christmas gift for my husband, he is missing Kenya and his family there very much. I hope this will bring Kenya to him in small way. I really can't wait to see his face when he unwraps it on Christmas! It only took a few days to receive the tea. The package was well packed so there are no dents or breaks in the box. I am very happy with this purchase, and I can't wait to sit and have a cup with my husband like we did every morning in Kenya! :) I very much recommend this tea to any tea drinker.

Samson LOVES this stuff too, with the Iams I had to entice him to eat by mixing it with canned food/tablefood, but with the Canidae, he eagerly wolfs it down by itself. And why not? The first 4 ingredients are all meats- human-grade at that! Besides having less ""filler"", Canidae uses no corn products, which is good for dogs with allergies (corn is a common allergen in dogs). Some may balk at the price, but you are going to use less food per day then with the junk brands due to the high quality of indredients in this stuff. Besides, Canidae is considerably cheaper then most of the other top-shelf brands like Eagle Pack or Flint River. I'm just happy to be able to feed my dog a ""super-premium"" grade food knowing how much healthier this is for him, for just a few bucks more per bag then a mid-grade food like Iams or Pro Plan.
